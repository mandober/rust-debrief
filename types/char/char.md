# Character

Primitive scalar type.

A value of type `char` is a Unicode scalar value (non-surrogate code point),
represented as a 32-bit unsigned word in the
`0x0000 to 0xD7FF` or `0xE000 to 0x10FFFF` range.

An array of chars is effectively an `UCS-4/UTF-32` string.


## ID
name: character
type: `char`
sample: 'a', '√ü', '‚ù§Ô∏è', '‚ù§', 'üíù'
sized: yes
size: 32b (4B)
storage: stack
primitive: yes
scalar: yes
module: yes
ownership: Copy


`char` type represents a single *unicode scalar value*.
More specifically, since character isn't a well-defined concept in Unicode,
`char` is a unicode scalar value, which is similar to, but not the same as,
a unicode code point.

- char is always 4 bytes in size.
- char is a UNICODE SCALAR VALUE
- unicode scalar values: from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive.
- char is always 4 bytes in size (4b)
- create chars always in single quotes


```rust
let c = '√ü';
// type annotated
let hearts: char = '‚ù§Ô∏è';

if c.is_alphabetic() {
    println!("Alphabetical");
} else if c.is_numeric() {
    println!("Numerical");
} else {
    println!("Neither");
}
```
