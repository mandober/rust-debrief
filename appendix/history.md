Euclid Egypt, c. 325–265 bc.
For Euclid, mathematics consists of proofs and
constructions.

Al-Khwarizmı Baghdad, c. 780–850.
For Al-Khwarizmı, mathematics consists of
calculations.

G. W. Leibniz Germany, 1646–1716.
According to Leibniz, we can calculate whether a
proof is correct. This will need a suitable language
(a universal characteristic) for writing proofs.

Gottlob Frege Germany, 1848–1925.
Frege invented a universal characteristic. He called
it Concept-script (Begriffsschrift)

Gottlob Frege Germany, 1848–1925.
Frege invented a universal characteristic. He called
it Concept-script (Begriffsschrift).

Gerhard Gentzen Germany, 1909–1945.
Gentzen’s system of natural deduction allows us to
write proofs in a way that is mathematically
natural.
