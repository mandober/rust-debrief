[A Gentle Introduction to Practical Types | Leo Tindall](https://leotindall.com/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/)
by Leo Tindall
Programmers talk a lot about types, but what is a type, anyway? It is, in essence, the set of all possible values for some variable.

[Multithreading in Rust with MPSC](https://blog.softwaremill.com/multithreading-in-rust-with-mpsc-multi-producer-single-consumer-channels-db0fc91ae3fa)
Nov 2017
Historically, multithreading has always been a double-edged sword. It saves a lot of time and resources by speeding up heavy computations (by parallelising them), but on the other hand — it can easily introduce countless situations of unpredictable behaviour, often difficult to reproduce, debug, or even identify before they actually bring down your application.

[Rust-101: main.rs](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html)
This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language.

[The (unofficial) Rust FFI Guide](https://michael-f-bryan.github.io/rust-ffi-guide/)
by Michael F.Bryan
Given Rust's popularity and position as a systems programming language, you'll probably reach a point where you want to integrate a Rust module into some existing application. This guide was created to fill the current gap in knowledge when it comes to doing more in-depth FFI tasks than simply calling one or two functions from a C library.

[The Sized Trait](http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/01/the-sized-trait/)
by Huon Wilson, Jan 2015
An important piece in my story about trait objects in Rust is the Sized trait, so I'm slotting in this short post between my discussion of low-level details and the post on "object safety".

[Rust's Type System is Turing-Complete](https://sdleffler.github.io/RustTypeSystemTuringComplete/)
by Sean Leffler
Not so long ago, a certain someone made a challenge on the Rust subreddit asserting that while everyone likes to say that Rust’s type system is Turing-complete, no one actually seems to have a proof anywhere. In response to that post, I constructed a proof in the form of an implementation of Smallfuck – a known Turing-complete language – entirely in the Rust type system. This blog post is an attempt to explain the inner workings of that Smallfuck implementation, as while as what this means for the Rust type system.
