# Greek numerals

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals

Glyph as numbers in classic Greek language 

Greek letters were also used to write numbers.
In the classical Ionian system
- the first 9 letters stood for the numbers 1-9
- the next 9 letters stood for the multiples of 10, 10-90
- the next 9 letters stood for the multiples of 100, 100-900

For this purpose, in addition to the 24 letters (which by that time made up the standard alphabet), 3 otherwise obsolete letters were retained or revived:
- digamma, `ϝ`, for 6
- koppa, `Ϙ`, for 90
- sampi, `Ͳ`, for 900

This system has remained in use in Greek up to the present day, although today it is only employed for limited purposes such as enumerating chapters in a book, similar to the way Roman numerals are used in English.

The 3 extra symbols are today written as `ϛ`, `ϟ`, `ϡ` respectively.

To mark a letter as a numeral sign, a small stroke called "_keraia_" (`ʹ`) is added to the right of it.
