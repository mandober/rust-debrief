# Structural rules

Structural rules are inference rules that don't refer to any logical connective, but operate on the judgment or sequents directly.

Logics that deny one or more of the structural rules are classified as substructural logics.

Common structural rules:
1. **Weakening**    
  where the hypotheses or conclusion of a sequent may be extended with additional members.
2. **Contraction**    
  where two unifiable members on the same side of a sequent may be replaced by a single member or a common instance.
3. **Exchange**    
  where two members on the same side of a sequent may be swapped.




Cut rule is a generalisation of the modus ponens. Although suspected merely a tool for abbreviating proofs, its superfluity is unproven.


## Monotonicity of entailment
Monotonicity of entailment is a property of many logical systems that states that the hypotheses of any derived fact may be freely extended with additional assumptions.

In sequent calculi this property can be captured by an inference rule called **weakening** and in such systems one may say that entailment is monotone iff the rule is admissible.

Logical systems with this property are occasionally called **monotonic logics** in order to differentiate them from non-monotonic logics.
