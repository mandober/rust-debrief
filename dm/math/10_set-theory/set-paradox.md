# Set Paradoxes

- Russell's paradox
- Cantor's paradox

The assumption that any property, without restriction, may be used to form a set leads to paradoxes. Thus consistent systems of na√Øve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.

## Russell's paradox
Russell's paradox is related to self-reference. As they say, whenever there's self-reference the paradox lurks near by.

According to naive set theory, any definable collection is a set. Let R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. If R is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. This contradiction is Russell's paradox.
