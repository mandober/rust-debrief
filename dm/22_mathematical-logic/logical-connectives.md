# Logical connectives

Logical connectives are symbols used to connect sentences in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective.

Connectives are unary, binary and n-ary. Binary connectives join two sentences which can be thought of as the function's operands.

Logical connectives along with quantifiers are the two main types of __logical constants__ used in formal systems such as propositional and predicate logic. Semantics of a logical connective can be presented as a truth (function) table.

- __negation__: $$\neg$$ (NOT)    
we can negate $$p$$, denoted by $$\neg p$$
- __disjunction__: $$\lor$$ (OR)    
we can introduce disjunction to state that at least one of propositions is true, denoted as $$p \lor r$$
- __conjunction__: $$\land$$ (AND)    
we can introduce conjunction to state that both propositions are true, denoted as $$p \land r$$
- __implication__: $$\to$$ (IF...THEN)   
we can introduce implication to state that one proposition is implied by on another, denoted as $$p \to r$$ ($$p$$ is __assumption__, $$q$$ is __conclusion__).
- __Bicondition__: $$\iff$$ (IFF)    
is a shorthand for $$(p\to q) \land (q\to p)$$, **iff**: if and only if.
- NOT has the highest precedence, followed by AND and OR which have the same precedence, then implication which is right-associative: $$p \to q \to r$$ means $$p \to (q \to r)$$.

A logical connective is similar to but not equivalent to a conditional operator.


⊥ ‘absurdity’
⊢ ‘turnstile’
⊨ ‘models’
∀ ‘for all’
∃ ‘there is’
tA ‘the interpretation of t in A’
⊨A φ ‘A is a model of φ’
≈ ‘has the same cardinality as’
≺ ‘has smaller cardinality than

The expression ‘x ↦ y’ is read as ‘x maps to y’, and is used for describing
functions.
