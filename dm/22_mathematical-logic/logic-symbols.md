# Logic symbols

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_logic_symbols


- The __falsum__ symbol, $$\bot$$
  - _false, bottom, falsity_
  - contradiction, unconditional falsity
  - expressed by $$Opq$$
- The __verum__ , $$\top$$
  - _true, top, tee_
  - tautology, unconditional truth
  - expressed by $$Vpq$$
- The __hook__ symbol, $$\lnot$$
  - _negation_, _NOT_
  - logical negation
  - unary operator
- The __wedge__ symbol, $$\land$$
  - _ascending wedge, AND, ac, atque_
  - conjunct $$\land$$ conjunct
  - logical conjunction
- The __vel__ symbol, $$\lor$$
  - _descending wedge, OR, vee_
  - disjunct $$\lor$$ disjunct
  - logical disjunction
- The __material implication__ symbol, $$\to$$
  - antecedent $$\to$$ consequent
  - read "_implies_", "_if...then_",
- The __turnstile__ symbol, $$\vdash$$
  - "_yields_", "_proves_", "_satisfies_" or "_entails_".
  - denotes syntactic consequence
- The __double turnstile__, $$\models$$
  - "_entails_", "_models_", "_makes true_", "_is stronger than_", "_is a semantic consequence of_"
  - semantic consequence, closely related to the turnstile, which denotes syntactic consequence.




## The turnstile

- Represents a binary relation
- Often read as "yields", "proves", "satisfies" or "entails"
- Created by Gottlob Frege in 1879
- Judgement of some content e.g. $$\vdash A$$ could be read as "I know $$A$$ is true". A conditional assertion $$P\vdash Q$$ could be read as "From $$P$$, I know that $$Q$$".
- In **proof theory** represents "provability". If $$T$$ is a formal theory and $$S$$ is a particular sentence in the language of the theory then $$T\vdash S$$ means that $$S$$ is provable from $$T$$. This usage is demonstrated in the article on propositional calculus.
- In the **typed lambda calculus**, the turnstile is used to separate typing assumptions from the typing judgment.
- In **category theory**, a reversed turnstile, as in $$F\dashv G$$, is used to indicate that the functor $$F$$ is left adjoint to the functor $$G$$. Rarely used like $$F\vdash G$$ to indicate that the functor $$F$$ is right adjoint to the functor $$G$$.
