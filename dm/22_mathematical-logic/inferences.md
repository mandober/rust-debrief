# Inference

Inferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences. They can be divided into 3 kinds: deduction, induction, and abduction.

Formal logic is the study of inference with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule i.e. a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. In many definitions of logic, _logical inference_ and _inference with purely formal content_ are the same.

Symbolic logic studies symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference.
