# Logical Argument


## Arguments
An argument, in its most basic form, is a group of statements, one or more of which (the premises) are claimed to provide support for, or reasons to believe, one of the others (the conclusion).

All arguments may be placed in one of two basic groups: those in which the premises really do support the conclusion and those in which they do not, even though they are claimed to. The former are said to be _good arguments_ (at least to that extent), the latter _bad arguments_.

The purpose of logic, as the science that evaluates arguments, is thus to develop methods and techniques that allow us to distinguish good arguments from bad.


## Premise
A premise is a statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion; it is an assumption that something is true.

In logic, an argument requires at least 2 propositions, known as the premises, along with another proposition known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure.

More complex arguments can use a series of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises which then act as premises for additional conclusions. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic.

Aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to two premises and a conclusion. Premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called __missing premises__, for example: "Socrates is mortal because all men are mortal". It is evident that the understood claim is that Socrates is a man.

The fully expressed reasoning is thus: Because all men are mortal and Socrates is a man, Socrates is mortal. In this example, the independent clauses preceding the comma (namely, "all men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man") are the premises, while "Socrates is mortal" is the conclusion.

The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the **validity** of the argument.


## Validity
In logic, an argument is valid iff it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false.

It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true, but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion.

A formula is valid iff it is true under every interpretation.

An argument form (or schema) is valid iff every argument of that logical form is valid.
