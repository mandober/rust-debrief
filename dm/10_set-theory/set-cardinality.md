__Cardinality__ of a set is the number of elements it contains. This number is also referred to as the __cardinal number__, denoted by $$\mathfrak{c}$$.

A __finite set__ has an finite number of elements, e.g. a finite set $$X=\{1,2,3,\dots,10\}$$ has cardinality 10, denoted by $$|X|=10$$.

An __infinite set__ has infinitely many elements; if $$X$$ is a infinite set, e.g. $$X=\{\dots,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots\}$$, its cardinality is denoted by $$|X|=\infty$$

A set is said to be **countable** if its elements can be placed in one to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.



If two sets contain the same elements they are said to be **equal sets**.

If two sets have the same cardinality they are called __equivalent sets__.

A set containing only one element is usually called a **singleton** or __unit__ set.

A set containing two elements may be referred to as an **unordered pair**.


The cardinality of a power set of an empty set is: $$\mathcal{P}(\varnothing) = 1$$.

The cardinality of a power set of a set $$X$$ is $$2^{|X|}$$.






$$|X| = |Y|$$ denotes two sets, $$X$$ and $$Y$$, having the same cardinality. In this case, there exists a __bijective__ function, $$f$$, mapping from $$X$$ to $$Y$$, $$f: X \mapsto Y$$.

$$|X|\le |Y|$$ denotes that cardinality of set $$X$$ is less than or equal to the cardinality of set $$Y$$. In this case there is an __injective__ function $$f$$ from $$X$$ to $$Y$$, $$f: X \mapsto Y$$

$$|X|\lt |Y|$$ denotes that cardinality of set $$X$$ is less than that of the set $$Y$$. In this case there is an __injective, but not bijective__ function.

If $$|X|\le |Y|$$ and $$|X|\ge |Y|$$ then $$|X| = |Y|$$. In this case $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are __equivalent__ sets.
