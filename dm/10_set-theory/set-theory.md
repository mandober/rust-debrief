## Naïve set theory
Naïve set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics. Unlike __axiomatic set theories__, which are defined using formal logic, naïve set theory is defined informally, in natural language.

It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.

Sets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Naïve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments.


## Quine's New Foundations (NF)
Quine's system of axiomatic set theory, NF, takes its name from the title "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic", which was a 1937 article which introduced it. The axioms of NF are extensionality together with stratified comprehension.
