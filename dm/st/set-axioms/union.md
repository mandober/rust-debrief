# Axiom of union

**Axiom of union**

_The union over the elements of a set exists_.

For example, the union over the elements of the set \{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\} is \{1,2,3\}.

The axiom of union states that for any set of sets {\mathcal {F)) there is a set A containing every element that is a member of some member of {\mathcal {F)):

\forall {\mathcal {F))\,\exists A\,\forall Y\,\forall x[(x\in Y\land Y\in {\mathcal {F)))\Rightarrow x\in A].
Although this formula doesn't directly assert the existence of {\displaystyle \cup {\mathcal {F))}, the set {\displaystyle \cup {\mathcal {F))} can be constructed from A in the above using the axiom schema of specification:

{\displaystyle \cup {\mathcal {F)):=\{x\in A:\exists Y(x\in Y\land Y\in {\mathcal {F)))\}.}
