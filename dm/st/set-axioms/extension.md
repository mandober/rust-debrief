# Axiom of extensionality

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_extensionality


**The axiom of extensionality** or **the axiom of extension** is an axiom of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that states that two sets are equal (they are the same set) if they contain the same elements, formally:

> $$\forall A\,\forall B\,(\forall X\,(X\in A\Rightarrow X\in B)\to A=B)$$

Given any set $$A$$ and any set $$B$$, **if** for every set $$X$$ holds that $$X$$ is a member of $$A$$ **iff** $$X$$ is a member of $$B$$ (i.e. $$A$$ and $$B$$ have the same elements) **then** $$A$$ is equal to $$B$$. It is not essential that $$X$$ here is a set, but in ZF everything is.

The converse, follows from the substitution property of equality:
$$\forall A\,\forall B\,(A=B\to \forall X\,(X\in A\Rightarrow X\in B))$$



The clause in parentheses states that $$A$$ and $$B$$ have precisely the same elements, thus the axiom is stating that two sets are equal iff they have precisely the same members. From that it follows that **a set is uniquely determined by its elements**.


The axiom of extensionality can be used with any statement of the form $$\exists A\,\forall X\,(X\in A\Rightarrow P(X)\,)$$, where $$P$$ is any unary predicate that does not mention $$A$$, to define a unique set $$A$$ whose members are precisely the sets satisfying the predicate $$P$$. We can then introduce a new symbol for $$A$$; it's in this way that definitions in ordinary mathematics ultimately work when their statements are reduced to purely set-theoretic terms.


## Modifications of the axiom of extension
The axiom of extensionality is uncontroversial in set-theoretical foundations of mathematics and it appears, with some modifications, in all alternative axiomatisations of set theory.

Predicate logic with equality is more frequently used then the **predicate logic without equality**, but in the latter case, the axiom can be modified so as to define $$x=y$$ as an abbreviation:

$$
\forall z[z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y]
\land 
\forall w[x\in w\Leftrightarrow y\in w]
$$

Then the axiom of extensionality can be reformulated as: 
$$
\forall x\,\forall y 
[
  \forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y)
  \Rightarrow 
  \forall w(x\in w\Leftrightarrow y\in w)
]
$$

which states that, if $$x$$ and $$y$$ have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.


In the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, there are no **ur-elements** (ur-element is a member of a set that is not itself a set), but they are included in some alternative axiomatisations of set theory.

So, in **set theory with ur-elements**, ur-elements can be treated as a different logical type from sets. In this case, $$B\in A$$ makes no sense if $$A$$ is an ur-element, so the axiom of extensionality simply applies only to sets.

Alternatively, in untyped logic, we can require $$B\in A$$ to be false whenever $$A$$ is an ur-element. In this case, the usual axiom of extensionality would then imply that every ur-element is equal to the empty set. To avoid this consequence, we can modify the axiom of extensionality to apply only to nonempty sets, so that it reads:

$$
\forall A\,\forall B\,
(
  \exists X\,(X\in A)
  \Rightarrow 
  [\forall Y\,(Y\in A\iff Y\in B)\Rightarrow A=B]
)
$$

Given any set $$A$$ and any set $$B$$, 
if $$A$$ is a nonempty set (i.e. if there exists an element $$X$$ in the set $$A$$), 
then, if $$A$$ and $$B$$ have precisely the same members, then 
they are equal.

Still another alternative in untyped logic is to define $$A$$ itself to be the only element of $$A$$ whenever $$A$$ is an ur-element. While this approach can serve to preserve the axiom of extensionality, the axiom of regularity will need an adjustment instead.
