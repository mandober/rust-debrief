# Axiom of infinity

**Axiom of infinity**

First few von Neumann ordinals:
0	= { }	= ∅
1	= { 0 }	= {∅}
2	= { 0, 1 }	= { ∅, {∅} }
3	= { 0, 1, 2 }	= { ∅, {∅} , {∅, {∅)) }
4	= { 0, 1, 2, 3 }	= { ∅, {∅}, {Ø, {Ø)), {Ø, {Ø}, {Ø, {Ø))} }

Let S(w) abbreviate {\displaystyle w\cup \{w\)), where w is some set. (We can see that \{w\} is a valid set by applying the Axiom of Pairing with {\displaystyle x=y=w} so that the set z is {\displaystyle \{w\))).

_Then there exists a set X such that the empty set \varnothing  is a member of X and, whenever a set y is a member of X, then S(y) is also a member of X_.

{\displaystyle \exists X\left[\varnothing \in X\land \forall y(y\in X\Rightarrow S(y)\in X)\right].}

More colloquially, there exists a set X having infinitely many members. (It must be established, however, that these members are all different, because if two elements are the same, the sequence will loop around in a finite cycle of sets. The axiom of regularity prevents this from happening.) The minimal set X satisfying the axiom of infinity is the von Neumann ordinal ω, which can also be thought of as the set of natural numbers \mathbb {N} .
