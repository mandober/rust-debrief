# Axiom of Regularity

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Axiom_of_regularity

**Axiom of regularity** or **axiom of foundation** states that every non-empty set $$x$$ contains a member $$y$$ such that $$x$$ and $$y$$ are disjoint sets.

$$
\forall x[
  \exists a(a\in x) 
  \Rightarrow 
  \exists y (
    y\in x 
    \land 
    \lnot \exists z(z\in y\land z\in x)
  )
]
$$

This implies, for example, that no set is an element of itself and that every set has an ordinal rank.
