# Set membership

The objects belonging to a set are called its __elements__ or __members__.

If an element $$a$$ is in a set $$A$$, its set membership is denoted by $$a \in A$$; if not, $$a \notin A$$ is used.

Expression $$a,b \in A$$ indicates the set membership for several things at once.

The order in which the elements of a set are specified or their repetition is of no consequence with regards to sets, e.g. this is the same set: $$\{a,b,c\}=\{b,c,b,a,a\}$$

Large sets can use abbreviation in the form of ellipsis: first, enough elements to easily infer their further sequence is listed, then elipsis, followed by the __terminal member__. For example, $$\{1,2,3,...,100\}$$.

Two sets are **equal** iff they contain the same elements. Extensionality gives us a way of proving that sets are identical by showing that whenever $$x\in X$$ then also $$x\in Y$$, and whenever $$y\in Y$$ then also $$y\in X$$.

Once a set has been formed, it is a __new entity__, different from any of its elements. A set containing one element is not the same as that element alone: $$p \neq \{p\}$$.

Sets need not contain just mathematical entities as elements, anything can be a member of a set, even other sets. A set whose elements are other sets are _collections of sets_. If an element $$a$$ is in the set $$A$$ and the set $$A$$ is in the set $$\mathscr{M}$$, that doesn't mean the element $$a$$ is in the set $$\mathscr{M}$$.


**The axiom of extension** states that two sets are equal if they have the same elements, i.e. they are equal in "extension" (scope, content), as opposed to equality in "intension" (meaning, concept).
The axiom of extension means that the set theory only deals with the content of sets, not with the concepts used to form them.
For example, the set of black US presidents is currently equal in extension to the set containing Barack Obama as a single element, but they are different in intension.
Two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements:
∀x:(x∈A⟺x∈B)⟺A=B
The order of the elements in the sets is immaterial.


In logic, **extensionality**, or extensional equality, refers to principles that judge objects to be equal if they have the same external properties. It stands in contrast to the concept of **intensionality**, which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same.
