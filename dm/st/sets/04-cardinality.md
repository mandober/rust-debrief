## Set equivalence
Sets $$S$$ and $$T$$ are equivalent iff they have the same cardinality. That is, if there exists a bijection function, $$f:S\to T$$, from the elements of $$S$$ to those of $$T$$

Set equivalence is denoted by $$S\sim T$$ or $$S\simeq T$$; inequivalence is denoted by $$S\not\sim{T}$$ or $$S\not\simeq{T}$$

Other notations for set equivalence include $$S\ Eq\ T$$ and $$Eq(S,T)$$

Equivalence is not the same thing as equality. Two sets are equal iff they are subsets of each other.

## Set enumeration
To count (enumerate) a set $$S$$ is to establish a bijection function between the set $$S$$ and an initial segment $$\mathbb{N_n}$$ of the set of natural numbers, $$\mathbb{N}$$.

The initial segment of the set of natural numbers (excluding zero) is determined by $$n$$: $${1,2,3,\dots,n}$$ and denoted by $$N_n$$

If $$S\simeq \mathbb{N_n}$$, then the set $$S$$ is countable and it has $$n$$ elements.

If $$S\simeq \mathbb{N}$$, then the set $$S$$ is infinite but countable.


# Set cardinality
**Cardinality**, the number of elements, of the set X is denoted by $$|X|$$. Two sets which are equivalent are said to have the same cardinality.

**Cardinality of a finite set**    
A finite set $$S$$ has cardinality $$n$$, that is, if $$S\simeq \mathbb{N} _{\lt n}$$, then we can define $$|S|=n$$ (where $$\mathbb{N} _{\lt n}$$ is a set of all natural numbers less than $$n$$).


## infinite set
An **infinite set** has infinitely many elements, e.g. $$\{\dots,1,2,3,\dots\}$$, i.e. it has infinite cardinality.

A **finite set**, e.g. $$\{1,2,3, \dots,100\}$$, with the last element acting as a *terminal set member*, has finite cardinality.
