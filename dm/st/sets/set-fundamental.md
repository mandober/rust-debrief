Some sets are so fundamental they have a special symbol assigned to them:

- $$\mathbb{B}$$ is the set of boolean values    
  $$\quad \{\bot,\top\}$$ or $$\{F,T\}$$ or $$\{0,1\}$$
- $$\mathbb{N}$$ is the set of natural numbers     
  $$\quad \mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$$
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is the set of integers     
  $$\quad \mathbb{Z}=\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$$.     
  The set of positive integers     
  $$\quad \mathbb{Z^+}=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$$
- $$\mathbb{Q}$$ is the set of rational numbers     
  $$\quad \{p/q : p \in\mathbb{Z}, q\in \mathbb{N}\land q\neq 0\}$$
- $$\mathbb{R}$$ is the set of real numbers.
- $$\mathbb{C}$$ is the set of complex numbers    
  $$\quad \{a,b\,i:a,b\in\mathbb{R}\}$$


$$\quad \mathbb{N}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\subseteq \mathbb{Q}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$$

Even though they are all infinite sets, it turns out that $$\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$$ have the same number of elements, while $$\mathbb{R}$$ has a whole lotta more. The former three are __enumerable__ and infinite whereas the latter R is __non-enumerable__ and infinite.
