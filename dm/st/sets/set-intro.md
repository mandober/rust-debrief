Although the theory of sets, initiated by Georg Cantor, constitutes the fundamental building blocks of all mathematics, with all mathematical objects resembling a set of some kind, the set is not formally defined , which raised many an eyebrow that expressed concerns about the sturdiness of a massive structure erected on such an undefined foundation, and shit. But, since the concept of a set is so ubiquitous and unavoidable, we must accept the term "set" as a primitive notion and let it be, sparing it from having to rigorously justify itself just like everybody else does.

> A set is a well-defined, unordered collection of distinct objects that share a common property; a set is considered as an object in its own right. A set is defined in terms of elements it contains.

**Naïve set theory** is an approach to set theory which assumes the existence of a universal set, despite the fact that such an assumption leads to paradoxes. It is founded upon the rigid set of axioms of propositional and predicate logic.

**Axiomatic set theory** is a system that constrains the sets, which are allowed to be generated, by axioms. The best known systems of axiomatic set theory are **ZF**, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, and **ZFC**, which is ZF with the additional _Axiom of Choice_.
