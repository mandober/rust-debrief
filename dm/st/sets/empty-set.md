A set containing no elements, $$\{\}$$, is the __empty set__, and it is nevertheless regarded as an existing object, usually denoted by $$\varnothing$$, so $$\{\}=\varnothing = \emptyset$$

The empty set is the only set whose cardinality is zero, $$|\varnothing|=0$$.

$$$
\varnothing = \{x:x\not\in X\}
$$$


> The empty set is a subset of any set.

$$$
\varnothing \subseteq X , \ \ \text{where X is any set}
$$$

> The empty set is a proper subset of any non-empty set.

$$$
\varnothing \subset X , \ \ \text{where X is a non-empty set}
$$$

Note: $$\varnothing=\{\}$$, $$\{\varnothing\}=\{\{\}\}$$, so $$\varnothing\neq \{\varnothing\} $$.



The __empty set__ is the set that has no elements. It is denoted as $$\varnothing$$ and it represents $$\{\}$$. The empty set is the only set whose cardinality is zero.


- $$\varnothing=\{\}\neq\{\{\}\}=\{\varnothing\} $$
- the empty set is regarded as an existing object.
- empty set is a subset of any set
