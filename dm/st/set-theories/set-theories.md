Naive set theory is the original set theory developed by mathematicians at the end of the 19th century, treating sets simply as collections of things.

Axiomatic set theory is a rigorous axiomatic theory developed in response to the discovery of serious flaws (such as Russell's paradox) in naive set theory. It treats sets as "whatever satisfies the axioms", and the notion of collections of things serves only as motivation for the axioms.

Internal set theory is an axiomatic extension of set theory that supports a logically consistent identification of unlimited (enormously large) and infinitesimal elements within the real numbers.

Various versions of logic have associated sorts of sets (such as fuzzy sets in fuzzy logic).



## Naive Set Theory
Naïve (unformalized) set theory describes the aspects of mathematical sets informally, using natural language. The words `and`, `or`, `if ... then`, `not`, `for some`, `for every` are treated as in ordinary mathematics.


## Axiomatic set theory
Axiomatic set theory describes the aspects of mathematical sets formally, using formal logic.

- Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF)
- Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with axiom of choice (ZFC)
- Kripke–Platek set theory
- general set theory that Burgess (2005) calls "ST"



## Naïve set theory
Naïve set theory is any of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the foundations of mathematics. Unlike __axiomatic set theories__, which are defined using formal logic, naïve set theory is defined informally, in natural language.

It describes the aspects of mathematical sets familiar in discrete mathematics (for example Venn diagrams and symbolic reasoning about their Boolean algebra), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.

Sets are of great importance in mathematics; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (numbers, relations, functions, etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Naïve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments.


## Quine's New Foundations (NF)
Quine's system of axiomatic set theory, NF, takes its name from the title "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic", which was a 1937 article which introduced it. The axioms of NF are extensionality together with stratified comprehension.
