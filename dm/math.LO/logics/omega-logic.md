# Omega logic

In set theory, Ω-logic is an infinitary logic and deductive system proposed by W. Hugh Woodin in 1999 as part of an attempt to generalize the theory of [determinacy][6] of [pointclasses][7] to cover [the structure][8]$$H_{\aleph_2}$$.

Just as the [axiom of projective determinacy][10] yields a canonical theory of $$H_{\aleph_1}$$, he sought to find axioms that would give a canonical theory for the larger structure. The theory he developed involves a controversial argument that the [continuum hypothesis][12] is false.


## Analysis

Woodin's **Ω-conjecture** asserts that if there is a proper class of [Woodin cardinals][13] (for technical reasons, most results in the theory are most easily stated under this assumption), then Ω-logic satisfies an analogue of the [completeness theorem][14]. From this conjecture, it can be shown that, if there is any single axiom which is comprehensive over  H ℵ 2 {displaystyle H_{aleph _{2))} ![H_{aleph _{2\)\)][9] (in Ω-logic), it must imply that the continuum is not  ℵ 1 {displaystyle aleph _{1)) ![aleph _{1}][15]. Woodin also isolated a specific axiom, a variation of [Martin's maximum][16], which states that any Ω-consistent  Π 2 {displaystyle Pi _{2)) ![Pi _{2}][17] (over  H ℵ 2 {displaystyle H_{aleph _{2))} ![H_{aleph _{2\)\)][9]) sentence is true; this axiom implies that the continuum is  ℵ 2 {displaystyle aleph _{2)) ![aleph _{2}][18]. 

Woodin also related his Ω-conjecture to a proposed abstract definition of large cardinals: he took a "large cardinal property" to be a  Σ 2 {displaystyle Sigma _{2)) ![Sigma _{2}][19] property  P ( α ) {displaystyle P(alpha )} ![P\(alpha \)][20] of ordinals which implies that α is a [strong inaccessible][21], and which is invariant under forcing by sets of cardinal less than α. Then the Ω-conjecture implies that if there are arbitrarily large models containing a large cardinal, this fact will be provable in Ω-logic. 

The theory involves a definition of **Ω-validity**: a statement is an Ω-valid consequence of a set theory _T_ if it holds in every model of _T_ having the form  V α B {displaystyle V_{alpha }^{mathbb {B} )) ![V_{alpha }^{mathbb {B} }][22] for some ordinal  α {displaystyle alpha } ![alpha ][23] and some forcing notion  B {displaystyle mathbb {B} } ![mathbb {B} ][24]. This notion is clearly preserved under forcing, and in the presence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals it will also be invariant under forcing (in other words, Ω-satisfiability is preserved under forcing as well). There is also a notion of **Ω-provability**;[[1]][25] here the "proofs" consist of [universally Baire sets][26] and are checked by verifying that for every countable transitive model of the theory, and every forcing notion in the model, the generic extension of the model (as calculated in _V_) contains the "proof", restricted its own reals. For a proof-set _A_ the condition to be checked here is called "_A_-closed". A complexity measure can be given on the proofs by their ranks in the [Wadge hierarchy][27]. Woodin showed that this notion of "provability" implies Ω-validity for sentences which are  Π 2 {displaystyle Pi _{2)) ![Pi _{2}][17] over _V_. The Ω-conjecture states that the converse of this result also holds. In all currently known [core models][28], it is known to be true; moreover the consistency strength of the large cardinals corresponds to the least proof-rank required to "prove" the existence of the cardinals.
