# Logical Inference

Inference is not to be confused with implication. An implication is a sentence of the form 'If p then q', and can be true or false.

The Stoic logician Philo of Megara was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true.

An inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form 'p therefore q'.

An inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid.

However, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication 'if p then q' is _true_, the inference 'p therefore q' is _valid_.

This was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by Philo, who said that the implication "if it is day, it is night" is true only at night, so the inference "it is day, therefore it is night" is valid at nighttime, but not during daytime.

The theory of inference (or 'consequences') was systematically developed in medieval times by logicians such as William of Ockham42 and Walter Burley64. It is uniquely medieval, though it has its origins in Aristotle's Topics65 and Boethius66' _De Syllogismis hypotheticis_. This is why many terms in logic are Latin. For example, the rule that licenses the move from the implication 'if p then q' plus the assertion of its antecedent p, to the assertion of the consequent q is known as modus ponens67 (or 'mode of positing'). Its Latin formulation is 'Posito antecedente ponitur consequens'. The Latin formulations of many other rules such as 'ex falso quodlibet' (anything follows from a falsehood), 'reductio ad absurdum' (disproof by showing the consequence is absurd) also date from this period. 

However, the theory of consequences, or of the so-called 'hypothetical syllogism68' was never fully integrated into the theory of the 'categorical syllogism'. This was partly because of the resistance to reducing the categorical judgment 'Every S is P' to the so-called hypothetical judgment 'if anything is S, it is P'. The first was thought to imply 'some S is P', the second was not, and as late as 1911 in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica69 article on Logic, we find the Oxford logician T.H. Case arguing against Sigwart's and Brentano's modern analysis of the universal proposition.
