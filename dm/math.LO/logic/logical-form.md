# Logical form

Logic is generally considered **formal** when it analyzes and represents the _form_ of any valid argument type. The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.

This is called showing the _logical form_ of the argument. It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as "but") with logical conjunctions like "and" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions ("any", "every", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as "all", or the universal quantifier ∀).

Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. Thus, for example, the expression "all Ps are Qs" shows the logical form common to the sentences "all men are mortals", "all cats are carnivores", "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on. The schema can further be condensed into the formula _A(P,Q)_, where the letter _A_ indicates the judgement 'all - are -'. 

The importance of form was recognised from ancient times.

Aristotle uses variable letters to represent valid inferences in _Prior Analytics_, leading Jan Łukasiewicz to say that the introduction of variables was "one of Aristotle's greatest inventions".

According to the followers of Aristotle (such as Ammonius), only the logical principles stated in schematic terms belong to logic, not those given in concrete terms.

The concrete terms "man", "mortal", etc., are analogous to the substitution values of the schematic placeholders $$P, Q, R$$, which were called the "matter" of the inference.

There is a big difference between the kinds of formulas seen in traditional term logic and the predicate calculus that is the fundamental advance of modern logic.

The formula, $$A(P,Q)$$, all $$P$$s are $$Q$$s, of traditional logic corresponds to the more complex formula in predicate logic: $$\forall x.(P(x)\to Q(x))$$, involving the logical connectives for universal quantification and implication rather than just the predicate letter $$A$$ and using variable arguments, $$P(x)$$, where traditional logic uses just the term letter $$P$$.

With the complexity comes power, and the advent of the predicate calculus inaugurated revolutionary growth of the subject.
