# Transitivity


A relation R ⊆ X2 is transitive iff, whenever Rxy and Ryz, then also Rxz.


**Transitive**
relation R on set A is called Transitive if xRy and yRz implies xRz,∀x,y,z∈A.
Example:
The relation R={(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)} on set A={1,2,3} is transitive.

## Transitive relations
A binary relation `R` over a set `X` is transitive if whenever an element `a` is related to an element `b` and `b` is related to an element `c` then `a` is also related to `c`.

Transitivity (or transitiveness) is a key property of both _partial order_ relations and _equivalence_ relations.

Formal definition: `∀ a,b,c ∈ X: a ⥽ b ∧ b ⥽ c ⇒ a ⥽ c`


## transitive
For example, "is ancestor of" is transitive, while "is parent of" is not. A transitive relation is irreflexive if and only if it is asymmetric.
