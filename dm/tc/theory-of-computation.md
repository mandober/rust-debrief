# Theory of Computation

The goal of the theory of computation is to develop formal mathematical models of computation that reflect real-world computers.

Theory of computation can be divided into 3 areas:
- Complexity theory (CXT)
- Computability theory (CMT)
- Automata theory (AT)


## Complexity theory
The central questions of complexity theory:
- What makes some problems computationally hard and other problems easy.
- Classifying problems according to their degree of "difficulty".
- Giving a rigorous proof that problems that seems "hard" are "hard" indeed.


## Automata theory
The cntral questions of automata theory:
- Whether different models have the same power
- Can a certain model solve more problems than the other

Automata theory deals with definitions and properties of different types of
computation models including:
- **Finite Automata**: used in text processing, compilers, hardware design.
- **Context-Free Grammars**: used to define programming languages. Also in AI.
- **Turing Machines**: form a simple abstract model of a computer.


## Computability theory
The central questions of computability theory:
- Classifying problems as solvable or unsolvable.
- Whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false.

In the 30's, it was discovered by Godel, Turing, Church that some of the fundamental problems in mathematics cannot be solved by a "computer" (even though computers crossed from theory into practice only in the 40's).

An example of such a problem is answering whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false. To tackle such a problem, formal definitions of the notions of computer, algorithm and computation were needed. The theoretical models that were proposed in order to understand solvable and unsolvable problems led to the development of computers.
