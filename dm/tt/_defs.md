## The Curry-Howard Isomorphism
We can consider propositions and types as the same thing i.e. the propositions-as-types notion, also known as the Curry-Howard isomorphism.


## Hindley–Milner type system

Hindley–Milner (HM) type system, a type system for the parametricaly polymorphic lambda calculus, has the ability to infer the majority of types without relying on type annotations, by employing an efficient type inference method called _Algorithm W_.

## Type Class
A type class is a type system construct that supports ad hoc polymorphism. This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in parametrically polymorphic types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class T and a type variable a, and means that a can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with T.
