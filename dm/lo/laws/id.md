# The Law of Identity (ID)

Each thing, whether a universal or a particular thing, is composed of its own unique set of characteristic qualities, which the ancient Greeks called its *essence*.

The law of identity states that each thing is identical with itself, denoted by $$a=a,\ Epp,\ \forall x: x=x$$

The modern formulation of identity is that of Gottfried Leibniz:    
$$x$$ is the same as $$y$$ iff every predicate true of $$x$$ is true of $$y$$ as well.
