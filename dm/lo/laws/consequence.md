# Logical consequence


If an argument with premises $$\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n$$ 
and conclusion $$\psi$$ is valid, 
then $$\psi$$ is a logical consequence of $$\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n$$.

We can also define logical consequence directly in terms of truth-value assignments: 
$$\psi$$ is a logical consequence of $$\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n$$ 
iff every truth-value assignment 
that makes $$\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n$$ true 
also makes $$\psi$$ true.
