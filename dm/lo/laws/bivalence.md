## Principle of bivalence

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Principle_of_bivalence


> The principle of bivalence states that every declarative sentence expressing a proposition has exactly one truth value, true or false, not both, not neither.

A logic satisfying this principle is called a **two-valued** or **bivalent** logic.

In formal logic, the principle of bivalence becomes a property that a semantics may or may not possess.

It is not the same as **the law of excluded middle** , and a semantics may satisfy that law without being bivalent.

The principle of bivalence is related to the law of excluded middle though the latter is a syntactic expression of the language of a logic of the form $$P \lor \lnot P$$.

The difference between the bivalence principle and the law of excluded middle is important because there are logics which validate the law but which do not validate the principle.

For example, the three-valued **Logic of Paradox (LP)** validates the law of excluded middle, but not **the law of non-contradiction**, ¬(P ∧ ¬P), and its intended semantics is not bivalent.

In classical two-valued logic both the law of excluded middle and the law of non-contradiction hold.

Many modern logic programming systems replace the law of the excluded middle with the concept of **negation as failure (NAF)**.
