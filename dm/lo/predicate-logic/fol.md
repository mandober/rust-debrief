# FOL

FOL is a family of languages, all having a similar grammar and sharing certain important vocabulary items, known as the connectives and quantifiers. Languages in this family can differ in the specific vocabulary used to form their most basic sentences, the so-called atomic sentences.

## Atomic sentence
is the most basic sentences in the language that can be used to make a claim about the world. That is, it's the smallest unit that can be said to have a truth value i.e. to be either true or false (not both, not neither).

## Constants
Individual constants are symbols used to refer to some fixed individual object, that function in FOL much the same way the names do in a natural language.

Constants are written with a sequence of characters beginning with a lower case letter (usually picked from the front of the English alphabet) with or without the subscript and superscript.

To be completelly unabiguous, every individual constant denotes (names or refers to) a single individual or object in the world.

In FOL we assume that every individual constant refers to exactly one object. Some objects are referred to by more than one constant and some by no constant symbol at all. Those are the objects that don't have names in the language (either natural or FOL).
