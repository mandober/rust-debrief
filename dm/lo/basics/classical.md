# Principles and laws


## Classical logic

Classical logic (or standard logic) is an intensively studied and widely used class of formal logics.

Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties.

Principles
1. Law of excluded middle
  - Double negative
  - Reductio ad absurdum
2. Law of noncontradiction
  - The principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet)
3. Monotonicity of entailment (weakening)
4. Idempotency of entailment (contraction)
4. Commutativity of conjunction
5. De Morgan duality: every logical operator is dual to another
6. Principle of bivalence (either true orfalse, not both, not neither)
7. The law of identity

Most semantics of classical logic are bivalent, meaning all of the possible denotations of propositions can be categorised as either true or false.
