# Principles and laws




## Classical logic

Classical logic (or standard logic) is an intensively studied and widely used class of formal logics.

Each logical system in this class shares characteristic properties.


Principles
1. Law of excluded middle
  - Double negative
  - Reductio ad absurdum
2. Law of noncontradiction
  - The principle of explosion (ex falso quodlibet)
3. Monotonicity of entailment (weakening)
4. Idempotency of entailment (contraction)
4. Commutativity of conjunction
5. De Morgan duality: every logical operator is dual to another
6. Principle of bivalence (either true orfalse, not both, not neither)
7. The law of identity


The law of identity: the modern formulation of identity is that of Gottfried Leibniz, who held that x is the same as y iff every predicate true of x is true of y as well.


Quialities:
1. Soundness
2. Completeness
3. Validity
4. Compactness


Kinds of inference rules:
- Admissible rule
- Derivable rule

List of inference rules:
- Modus ponens
- The Kreiselâ€“Putnam rule (KPR) or Independence of Premise



While not entailed by the preceding conditions, contemporary discussions of classical logic normally only include propositional and first-order logics. 

In other words, the overwhelming majority of time spent studying classical logic has been spent studying specifically propositional and first-order logic, as opposed to the other more obscure variations of classical logic.

Most semantics of classical logic are bivalent, meaning all of the possible denotations of propositions can be categorised as either true or false.
