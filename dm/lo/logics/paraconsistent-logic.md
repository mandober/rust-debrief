# Paraconsistent logic


A **paraconsistent logic** is a logical system that attempts to deal with contradictions in a discriminating manner.

Paraconsistent logic is the subfield of logic that is concerned with studying and developing paraconsistent or inconsistency tolerant logic systems.

The defining feature of a paraconsistent logic is that it rejects the **principle of explosion**.

As a result, paraconsistent logics, unlike classical and other logics, can be used to formalize inconsistent but non-trivial theories.
