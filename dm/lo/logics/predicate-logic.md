# Predicate logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_logic

First-order logic without variables or quantifiers is sometimes called _zeroth-order logic_.

Some authors use the phrase "zeroth-order logic" as a synonym for the propositional calculus, but an alternative definition extends propositional logic by adding *constants, operations, and relations on non-Boolean values*. Every zeroth-order language in this broader sense is complete and compact.
