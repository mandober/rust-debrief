# Varieties of logic


## Infinitary logic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_logic
An infinitary logic allows infinitely long statements or proofs.

Infinitary logics may have different properties from FOL, such as the lack of compactness and completeness.

Notions of compactness and completeness that are equivalent in finitary logic, sometimes are not equivalent in infinitary logics.




Non-Monotonic Logics
Logics (devised for AI) in which adding premises may diminish the set of derivable conclusions.
Logical Frameworks
These are logical systems which are intended to provide a framework within which work can be undertaken in a wide range of different logics. The framework may provide a formal metalanguage in which the various logics are defined, or a core logic, of which the various logics are extensions.
Programming Logics
These are logical systems customised to reasoning about programs in some particular programming language, or general schemes and methods for reasoning about programs (e.g. Hoare Logic).
Specification Logics
These are the inference systems associated with formal specification languages (such as may be used in the specification of highly secure or safety critical systems).
