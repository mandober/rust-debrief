Logics
- __Two-valued logic__ is classical logic with `true` and `false` values, but it may be extended to __n-valued logic__ (n > 2).
- __Many-valued__ logic (multi- or multiple-) is a _propositional calculus_ in which there are more than two truth values.
- __Three-valued__ e.g. Łukasiewicz's and Kleene's, accepting `true`, `false`, and `unknown`
- **Finite-valued** (Finitely-many valued) with more than 3 values
- **Infinite-valued** (Infinitely-many valued)
  - **Fuzzy logic**
  - **Probability logic**
