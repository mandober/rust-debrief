# First-order logic

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic


First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals; second-order logic, in addition, also quantifies over sets; third-order logic also quantifies over sets of sets, and so on.

Higher-order logic is the union of first-, second-, third-, â€¦, nth-order logic; i.e., higher-order logic admits quantification over sets that are nested arbitrarily deeply.


The characteristic feature of first-order logic is that individuals can be quantified, but not predicates. Second-order logic extends first-order logic by adding the latter type of quantification. Other higher-order logics allow quantification over even higher types than second-order logic permits. These higher types include relations between relations, functions from relations to relations between relations, and other higher-type objects. Thus _the "first" in first-order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified_.
