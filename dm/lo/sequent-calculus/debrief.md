# Sequent Calculus: Debriefing

- A sequent is a general kind of conditional assertion
- $$antecedent \land antecedent \vdash consequent \lor succedent$$
- turnstile: "_therefore_", "_entails_", "_implies_", "_proves_"

A sequent may have any number of _condition formulas_ (on the left side), called **antecedents**, and any number of _asserted formulas_ (on the right side), called **succedents** or **consequents**. Together they are called __cedents__ or __sequents__.


$$antecedent \land antecedent \vdash consequent \lor succedent$$

$$\Gamma \vdash \Sigma$$
