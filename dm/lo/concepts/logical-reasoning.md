# Logical reasoning 

There are 3 kinds of logical reasoning:
1. Abduction
1. Deduction
1. Induction


__Abductive reasoning__ (also called abduction, abductive inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation or s set of observations, then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation.

__Deductive reasoning__, also deductive logic, logical deduction is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion. Deductive reasoning goes in the same direction as that of the conditionals, and links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.

__Inductive reasoning__ (as opposed to deductive reasoning or abductive reasoning) is a method of reasoning in which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of the conclusion. While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may be probable, based upon the evidence given.Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning as the derivation of general principles from specific observations, though some sources disagree with this usage.The philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than simple progression from particular/individual instances to broader generalizations.


Given
- a precondition or a premise
- a conclusion or a logical consequence
- a rule or material conditional that implies the conclusion given the precondition, one can explain that

__Deductive__ reasoning
  determines whether
  the truth of a conclusion
  can be determined for that rule, 
  based solely on the truth of the premises.
  Example: "When it rains, things outside get wet. The grass is outside therefore: when it rains, the grass gets wet".
  Mathematical and philosophical logic are associated with this type of reasoning.

__Inductive__ reasoning
  attempts to support a determination of the rule.
  It hypothesizes a rule after numerous examples are taken
  to be a conclusion that follows from a precondition in terms of such a rule. 
  Example: "The grass got wet numerous times when it rained, therefore: the grass always gets wet when it rains". While they may be persuasive, these arguments are not deductively valid (see the problem of induction).
  Science is associated with this type of reasoning.

__Abductive__ reasoning, a.k.a. inference 
  to the best explanation, 
  selects a cogent set of preconditions.
  Given a true conclusion and a rule, 
  it attempts to select some possible premises 
  that, if true also, can support the conclusion, 
  though not uniquely. 
  Example:
  "When it rains, the grass gets wet. 
  The grass is wet. 
  Therefore, it might have rained." 
  This kind of reasoning can be used to develop a hypothesis, 
  which in turn can be tested by additional reasoning or data. 
  Diagnosticians, detectives, and scientists often use this type of reasoning.

## Logic and rationality
As the study of _argument_ is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, logic is of essential importance to rationality.

Here we have defined logic to be "the systematic study of the form of arguments". The reasoning behind argument is of several sorts, but only some of these arguments fall under the aegis of logic proper.

Logical reasoning:
- deductive
- inductive
- abductive


_Deductive reasoning_ concerns the _logical consequence_ of given _premises_ and is the form of reasoning most closely connected to logic.

There are other forms of rational reasoning, but are generally not taken to be part of logic.

These include _inductive reasoning_, which covers forms of inference that move from collections of particular judgements to universal judgements, and _abductive reasoning_, which is a form of inference that goes from observation to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data (observation) and seeks to explain relevant evidence.

The American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1839â€“1914) first introduced the term as "guessing". Peirce said that to _abduce_ a hypothetical explanation  `a` from an observed surprising circumstance `b`is to surmise that `a` may be true because then `b` would be a matter of course. Thus, to abduce `a` from `b` involves determining that `a` is sufficient (or nearly sufficient), but not necessary, for `b`. 

While inductive and abductive inference are not part of logic proper, the methodology of logic has been applied to them with some degree of success. For example, the notion of _deductive validity_ (where an inference is deductively valid iff there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false) exists in an analogy to the notion of _inductive validity_, or "strength", where an inference is inductively strong iff its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.

Whereas the notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of semantics, inductive validity requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations.

The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association rule induction, while others may use mathematical models of probability such as decision trees.
