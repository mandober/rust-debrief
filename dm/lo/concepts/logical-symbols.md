# Mathematical and Logic Symbols

List of common symbols used in various logics.

- The __verum__: $$\top$$
  - _true, top, tee_, `T`
  - tautology, unconditional truth
- The __falsum__: $$\bot$$
  - _false, bottom, falsity_, `⊥`
  - contradiction, unconditional falsity, absurdity
- The __hook__: $$\lnot$$
  - _negation_, _NOT_, `¬`
  - logical negation
- The __wedge__: $$\land$$
  - _ascending wedge, AND, ac, atque_, `∧`
  - logical conjunction
- The __vel__: $$\lor$$
  - _descending wedge, OR, vee_, `v`
  - logical disjunction
- The __arrow__:
  - arrows: $$\to$$, $$\Rightarrow$$, $$\implies$$
  - glyphs: `→`, `⇒`, `⟹`
  - read as "_implies_", "_if...then_"
  - logical (material) implication
  - bigger arrows may represent higher precedence
- The __double arrow__:
  - "_if and only if_"
  - logical biconditional, $$\iff$$
  - material equivalence, $$\Leftrightarrow$$,`⇔`
  - equivalence, $$\leftrightarrow$$, ` ↔`
  - logical equivalence, $$\equiv$$, `≡`
  - bigger arrows may represent higher precedence
- The __turnstile__: $$\vdash$$
  - glyph`⊢`
  - "right tack", "tee", "assertion sign" symbol
  - "_yields_", "_proves_", "_satisfies_", "_entails_"
  - symbol for assertion, entailment, implication
  - syntactic consequence
- The __double turnstile__, $$\models$$
  - "_entails_", "_models_", "_makes true_", "_is stronger than_", "_is a semantic consequence of_", `⊨`
  - semantic consequence
  - "A is a model of φ": `⊨A φ`
- The __for all__: $$\forall$$
  - "_for all_", `∀`
  - universal quantifier
- The __there exists__: $$\exists$$
  - "_there is_", "_there exists_", `∃`
  - existential quantifier
  - unique existential quantifier: `∃!`
- Other symbols:
  - "_has the same cardinality as_": `≈`
  - "_has smaller cardinality than_": `≺`
  - "_x maps to y_" (functions): `x ↦ y`





## The turnstile
- Represents: binary relation, assertion symbol
- Commonly seen in sequent calculus
- Often read as "_yields_", "_proves_", "_satisfies_", "_entails_"
- Created by Gottlob Frege in 1879
- Judgement of some content e.g. $$\vdash A$$ could be read as "I know $$A$$ is true".
- A conditional assertion $$P\vdash Q$$ could be read as "From $$P$$, I know that $$Q$$".
- In **proof theory** represents provability: if $$T$$ is a formal theory and $$S$$ is a particular sentence in the language of the theory then $$T\vdash S$$ means that $$S$$ is provable from $$T$$.
- In the **typed lambda calculus** the turnstile is used to separate typing assumptions from the typing judgment.
- In **category theory**, a reversed turnstile, as in $$F\dashv G$$, is used to indicate that the functor $$F$$ is left adjoint to the functor $$G$$. It is rarely used as $$F\vdash G$$ to indicate that the functor $$F$$ is right adjoint to the functor $$G$$.
