## Module `std::collections::linked_list`

A doubly-linked list with owned nodes.

The LinkedList allows pushing and popping elements at either end in constant time.

Almost always it is better to use Vec or VecDeque instead of LinkedList. In general, array-based containers are faster, more memory efficient and make better use of CPU cache.

**Traits**
`RangeArgument` [LAB] RangeArgument is implby Rust's built-in range types, produced by range syntax like `..`, `a..`, `..b` or `c..d`.
