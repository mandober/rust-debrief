An implementation is an item, defined with the keyword `impl`, that associates (other) items with a particular type. The type in this role is called the implementing type, denoted as `Self`.

There are two types of implementations:
- [inherent implementation](inherent-implementation.md)
- [trait implementation](trait-implementation.md)
