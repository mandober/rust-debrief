## Generic functions

A generic function allows one or more parameterized types to appear in its signature. Each type parameter must be explicitly declared in an angle-bracket-enclosed and comma-separated list, following the function name.

```rust
// foo is generic over A and B
fn foo<A, B>(x: A, y: B) {
```

Inside the function signature and body, the name of the type parameter can be used as a type name. Trait bounds can be specified for type parameters to allow methods with that trait to be called on values of that type. This is specified using the where syntax:

```rust
fn foo<T>(x: T) where T: Debug {
```

When a generic function is referenced, *its type is instantiated* based on the context of the reference. For example, calling the foo function here:

```rust
fn foo<T>(x: &[T]) where T: std::fmt::Debug { /** details elided */ }

foo(&[1, 2]);
```
will instantiate type parameter `T` with `i32`.


The type parameters can also be explicitly supplied in a *trailing path component* after the function name.

This might be necessary if there is not sufficient context to determine the type parameters. For example:

```rust
mem::size_of::<u32>() == 4
```
