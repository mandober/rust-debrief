## Extern functions

Extern functions are part of Rust's foreign function interface, providing the opposite functionality to external blocks. Whereas external blocks allow Rust code to call foreign code, extern functions with bodies defined in Rust code can be called by foreign code. They are defined in the same way as any other Rust function, except that they have the extern modifier.


```rust
// Declares an extern fn, the ABI defaults to "C"
extern fn new_i32() -> i32 { 0 }

// Declares an extern fn with "stdcall" ABI
extern "stdcall" fn new_i32_stdcall() -> i32 { 0 }
```

Unlike normal functions, extern fns have type extern "ABI" fn(). This is the same type as the functions declared in an extern block.

```rust
let fptr: extern "C" fn() -> i32 = new_i32;
```
