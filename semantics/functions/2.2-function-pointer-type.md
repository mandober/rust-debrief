## Function pointer type

Function pointer types, written using the `fn` keyword, refer to a function whose identity is not necessarily known at compile-time.

Function pointers can be created via a *coercion* from both, *function items* and *non-capturing closures*.

A function pointer type consists of a possibly-empty set of function-type modifiers (such as unsafe or extern), a sequence of input types and an output type.


Example: function pointer type and its annotation:

```rust
let adder: fn(u8, u8) -> u8 = |x, y| x + y;
let y = adder(4, 5);


fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}

let mut x = add(5,7);

// type alias
type Binop = fn(i32, i32) -> i32;
// annotating with type alias
let bo: Binop = add;
// instead of:
let bo: fn(i32, i32) -> i32 = add;

x = bo(5,7);
```
