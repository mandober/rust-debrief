# Closure types

A closure expression produces a closure value with a *unique, anonymous type* that cannot be written out.

Depending on the requirements of the closure, its type implements one or more of the closure traits:

`FnOnce`
The closure can be called once. A closure called as FnOnce can move out of its captured values.
`FnMut`
The closure can be called multiple times as mutable. A closure called as FnMut can mutate values from its environment. FnMut inherits from FnOnce (i.e. anything implementing FnMut also implements FnOnce).
`Fn`
The closure can be called multiple times through a shared reference. A closure called as Fn can neither move out from nor mutate captured variables, but read-only access to such values is allowed. Using move to capture variables by value is allowed so long as they aren't mutated or moved in the body of the closure. Fn inherits from FnMut, which itself inherits from FnOnce.


Closures that don't use anything from their environment ("non capturing closures") can be *coerced to function pointers* (fn) with the matching signature.

```rust
let add = |x, y| x + y;

let mut x = add(5,7);

type Binop = fn(i32, i32) -> i32;
let bo: Binop = add;
x = bo(5,7);
```
