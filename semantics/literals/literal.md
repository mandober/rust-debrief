# Literals

**Tokens** are primitive productions in the grammar 
defined by regular (non-recursive) languages.

"Simple" tokens are given in string table production form, and occur in the rest 
of the grammar as double-quoted strings. Other tokens have exact rules given.

> A **literal** is an expression consisting of a single token,
> that immediately and directly denotes the value it evaluates to.

A literal is an expression consisting of a single token, rather than a sequence 
of tokens, that immediately and directly denotes the value it evaluates to,
rather than referring to it by name or some other evaluation rule.

A literal is a form of **constant expression**,
so is evaluated (primarily) at compile time.


There are no negative integer literals (only negation expressions).
