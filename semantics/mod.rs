//! MODULES

/**
The `mod` keyword declares a new module.
Code within the module appears either immediately following
this declaration within curly braces or in another file.

By default, functions, types, constants, and modules are private.
The `pub` keyword makes an item public and therefore visible outside its namespace.

The `use` keyword brings modules, or the definitions inside modules,
into scope so itâ€™s easier to refer to them.
