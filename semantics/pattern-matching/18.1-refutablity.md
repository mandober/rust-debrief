# Refutability

Patterns come in two forms: refutable and irrefutable.

Patterns which cannot fail to match for any possible value are said to be *irrefutable*, and patterns which can fail to match for some possible value are said to be *refutable*. 

`let` statements, function parameters, and `for` loops are restricted to only accept irrefutable patterns, since there’s nothing correct the program could do if the pattern fails to match.

`if let`, and `while let` expressions are restricted to only accept refutable patterns, since they’re made to handle possible failure and we wouldn’t need their functionality if the pattern could never fail.
