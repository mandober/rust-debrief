# Category theory

**Mathematical structure** on a set is an additional object that attaches or relates to that set, endowing it with some extra meaning. Relations that preserve the structure, do so by mapping structures in the domain to the equivalent structures in the codomain:
- **homomorphisms** preserve algebraic structures
- **homeomorphisms** preserve topological structures
- **diffeomorphisms** preserve differential structures

Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane introduced the concepts of categories in 1940's in their study of algebraic topology, with the goal of understanding the processes that preserve mathematical structure.

Category theory may be used, instead of set theory, as an axiomatic foundation for mathematics.

Category theory formalizes mathematical structure in terms of a labeled directed graph called a **category** whose vertices are called **objects** and whose edges are called **morphisms** or **arrows**.

Category (labeled directed graph):
1. objects (vertices)
2. morphisms (edges)

A **morphism** is a structure-preserving map from one mathematical structure to another one of the same type.

Morphisms:
- set theory: morphisms are functions
- linear algebra: morphisms are linear transformations
- group theory: morphisms are group homomorphisms
- topology: morphisms are continuous functions
- etc.

In category theory, morphism is an abstract idea: mathematical objects need not be sets and the relationship between them may be more general than a mapping relation - but it still has to behave similarly to maps, for instance, function composition must be associative.

The study of morphisms and the objects over which they are defined is central to category theory.

Much of the terminology of morphisms, as well as the intuition underlying them, comes from concrete categories, where the objects are simply sets with some additional structure, and morphisms are structure-preserving functions.

A category has 2 basic properties:
1. the ability to compose the morphisms associatively
2. the existence of an identity morphisms for each object
