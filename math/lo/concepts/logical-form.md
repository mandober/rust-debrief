# Logical form


Logic is generally considered formal when it analyzes and represents the form of any valid argument type.

The form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference.

Simply put, to formalize simply means to translate English sentences into the language of logic.

This is called showing the logical form of the argument.

It is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical.

It requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic (such as gender and declension, if the argument is in Latin), replacing conjunctions irrelevant to logic (such as "but") with logical conjunctions like "and" and replacing ambiguous, or alternative logical expressions ("any", "every", etc.) with expressions of a standard type (such as "all", or the universal quantifier âˆ€).

Second, certain parts of the sentence must be replaced with schematic letters. 

Thus, for example, the expression "all Ps are Qs" shows the logical form common to the sentences "all men are mortals", "all cats are carnivores", "all Greeks are philosophers", and so on.
