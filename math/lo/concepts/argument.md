## Argument
An **argument**, in its simplest form, is a group of statements: at least two propositions, known as the **premises**, along with the final proposition, called the **conclusion**. An argument is a claim that the premises will justify its conclusion. A premise is an assumption that something is true.

The purpose of an argument is to provide a reason for accepting the truth of its conclusion, which must be a **statement**.

> The principle of bivalence: a statement has a truth value, it can either be true or false, not both, not neither.

Bad arguments are those in which the premises do not support the conclusion, contrary to their claim. Conversely, in good arguments the premises do support the conclusion.

> The proof of a conclusion depends on both, the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument.

The premises should be true to accept the conclusion of an argument as true, but also the premises should constitute evidence in favor of the truth of the conclusion. The steps leading from premises to conclusion should be **truth-preserving** - logical steps taken from true premises should lead to a true conclusion.
