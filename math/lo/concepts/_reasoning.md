Logic is a subject concerned with the most general laws of truth, it has traditionally included classification of arguments, systematic exposition of the logical form, study of semantics and logical reasoning, and is now held to consist of the systematic study of the valid forms of inference.

Logic evaluates arguments in order to develop methods that allow us to distinguish good and bad arguments, and codify correct ways of reasoning and drawing conclusion. Each kind of reasoning has a logic of the same name that studies it: abduction, induction and deduction. We're mostly interested in deductive logic because mathematical logic is associated with this type of reasoning.

Mathematical logic has emerged as a new field of mathematics in the XIX century. Similarly to other math branches, mathematical logic studies theorems about a system of objects, only here the objects are theorems themselves and the system is the whole of math.

Mathematical logic studies the applications of logic to mathematics and explores formal systems of deductive reasoning in formal proof systems. It includes mathematical fields that employ framework of formal logic system, such as set theory, model theory, computability theory, proof theory. Mathematical logic is thereby closely associated to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science.

Logics is the study of the valid forms of inference and a valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its conclusion.
