# Propositional logic: debrief

- PL is a branch of logic based on propositions
- propositions are declarative sentences that have a truth value
- formal language made by composition of atoms (indecomposable propositions) that are assign a symbol (p, q, r, etc.), and logical connectives: `¬ ∧ ∨ →`
- negation: `¬`, conjunction: `∧`, disjunction: `∨`, implication: `→`
- $$\neg$$ __negation__ (NOT): $$\neg p$$
- $$\land$$ __conjunction__ (AND): $$p \land r$$ (p and q are conjuncts)
- $$\lor$$ __disjunction__ (OR): $$p \lor r$$ (p and q are disjuncts)
-  $$\to$$ __implication__ (IMPLIES): $$p\to q$$ (p is antecedent, q is consequent)
- precedence: nagation > conjunction/disjunction > implication
