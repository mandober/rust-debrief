**Mathematics** studies numbers and space and objects in their ideal form, existing only in the platonic world where a line stretches infinitely and has no width.

**Logic** has traditionally included classification of arguments, systematic exposition of the logical form, study of inference and semantics, study of logical reasoning. Logic evaluates arguments in order to develop methods that allow us to distinguish good and bad arguments, and codify correct ways of reasoning and drawing conclusion. The eponymous logics study the 3 kinds of reasoning: abduction, induction and deduction.

**Abductive reasoning** is a form of logical inference which starts with observations, then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. Diagnosticians, detectives and scientists often use this type of reasoning.

**Inductive reasoning** is a method of reasoning in which the premises contribute some justification for the truth of the conclusion. The truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is never certain because it is generally based on the previous experience and the likelihood of it repeating. Science is associated with this type of reasoning.

**Deductive reasoning** (deductive logic, logical deduction) is the process of reasoning that starts with premises and proceeds to reach, a logically certain, conclusion. If all premises are true and the rules were strictly followed, then the conclusion is necessarily true. Mathematical logic is associated with this type of reasoning.


**Mathematical logic** studies the applications of symbolic logic to mathematics and explores formal systems of deductive reasoning in formal proof systems. It includes mathematical fields that employ framework of formal logic system, such as set theory, model theory, computability theory, proof theory. Mathematical logic is thereby closely associated to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science.
