## Introduction
Logic is a subject concerned with the most general laws of truth, and it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the logical form, the study of inference, fallacies, semantics, paradoxes, etc.

It is now held that **logic** is the systematic study of the valid forms of inference. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its conclusion.

Logic evaluates arguments in order to develop methods that allow us to distinguish good and bad arguments, and codify correct ways of reasoning and drawing conclusion. Each kind of reasoning has a logic of the same name that studies it: abduction, induction and deduction.

Logic has been studied in philosophy since ancient times, but from the XIX centry it became a part of matematics, and in modern times a part of many sciences, especially CS.


## Logical reasoning

**Abduction** is a form of logical inference which starts with observations, then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. This kind of reasoning can be used to develop a hypothesis, which in turn can be tested by additional reasoning or data. Diagnosticians, detectives and scientists often use this type of reasoning.

**Induction** is a method of reasoning in which the premises contribute some justification for the truth of the conclusion. The truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is never certain because it is generally based on the previous experience and the likelihood of it repeating. Science is associated with this type of reasoning. N.B. Inductive reasoning (inductive logic) and mathematical induction are completelly different things.

**Deduction** (deductive logic, logical deduction) is the process of reasoning that starts with premises and proceeds to reach, a logically certain, conclusion. If all premises are true and the rules were strictly followed, then the conclusion is necessarily true. Mathematics is associated with deductive reasoning.


## Mathematical logic

Mathematical logic studies the application of the techniques of formal logic to mathematics and explores formal systems of deductive reasoning in formal proof systems. It also studies the application of mathematical techniques to the representation and analysis of formal logic.

**Logicism**, born during the foundations crises of mathematics, is the attempt to base mathematics in logic, and it was pioneered by logicians such as Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. The plan to prove mathematical theorems as logical tautologies, thus reducing math to logic, graaduately waned until it became impossible due to introduction of **Gödel's incompleteness theorems**.

Despite the negative nature of the incompleteness theorems, **Gödel's completeness theorem**, a result in model theory and another application of mathematics to logic, showed how close logicism came to being true. Namely, every rigorously defined mathematical theory can be captured precisely by a first-order logical theory.

Mathematical logic encompases branches of math that employ a formal logic system: set theory, model theory, computability theory, proof theory. It has initially emerged in the end of XIX century with the advent of formalization in mathematics.


The aim of logic in CS is to develop formal languages that can model concepts in programming languages, so we can reason about these models by constructing valid arguments that can be rigorously defended and proved, and preferably, checked mechanically for their correctness.
