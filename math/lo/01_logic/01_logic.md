## Introduction
Logic is a subject concerned with the most general laws of truth, and it has traditionally included the classification of arguments, the systematic exposition of the logical form, the study of inference, fallacies, semantics, paradoxes, etc.

It is now held that **logic** is the systematic study of the valid forms of inference. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its conclusion.

Logic evaluates arguments in order to develop methods that allow us to distinguish good and bad arguments, and codify correct ways of reasoning and drawing conclusion. Each kind of reasoning has a logic of the same name that studies it: abduction, induction and deduction.

Logic has been studied in philosophy since ancient times, but from the XIX centry it became a part of matematics, and in modern times a part of many sciences, especially CS.


## Logical reasoning

**Abduction** is a form of logical inference which starts with observations, then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. This kind of reasoning can be used to develop a hypothesis, which in turn can be tested by additional reasoning or data. Diagnosticians, detectives and scientists often use this type of reasoning.

**Induction** is a method of reasoning in which the premises contribute some justification for the truth of the conclusion. The truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is never certain because it is generally based on the previous experience and the likelihood of it repeating. Science is associated with this type of reasoning. **N.B.** Inductive reasoning (inductive logic) and mathematical induction are completelly different things.

However, we're mostly interested in deduction because mathematical logic is associated with this type of reasoning. **Deduction** (deductive logic, logical deduction) is the process of reasoning that starts with premises and proceeds to reach, a logically certain, conclusion. If all premises are true and the rules were strictly followed, then the conclusion is necessarily true.


## Mathematical logic

Mathematical logic has emerged as a new field of mathematics in the XIX century. Similarly to other math branches, mathematical logic studies theorems about a system of objects, only here the objects are theorems themselves and the system is the whole of math.

Mathematical logic studies the applications of logic to mathematics and explores formal systems of deductive reasoning in formal proof systems. ML has become a branch of math in the XIX century with the advent of formalization into mathematics.

ML includes mathematical fields that employ framework of formal logic system, such as set theory, model theory, computability theory, proof theory, thereby making ML closely associated to metamathematics, the foundations of mathematics and theoretical CS.


## Types of logic

The types of logic of interest to CS are syllogistic, propositional and predicate logic.

The syllogistic logic developed by Aristotle predominated in the West until the mid-XIX century, when interest in the foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of mathematical logic.
