**Number** is a mathematical object used to count, measure and label.

**Number systems** are sets of number classes, such as the natural numbers and the real numbers.

**Numeral** is the notational symbol that represents a number. It is important to differentiate between the properties of a number and properties of its numeral. For example, "being even" is a property of a number (regardless of the number system) and "sum of its digits" is a property of denotation (and it depends on the number system).

**Numeral system** (system of numeration) is a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set, using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. The same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems.


**Number theory**, a branch of pure mathematics, studies the properties of the natural numbers, such as divisibility and the distribution of primes.

**Combinatorics** studies the problems concerning counting and ordering, such as partitioning and enumerations.

**Arithmetic** is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations on them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms arithmetic and higher arithmetic were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for number theory and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.


**Fundamental sets**: some sets are so fundamental they have a special symbol assigned to them:
- $$\mathbb{B}$$ is the set of boolean values (or Boolean domain)    
  $$\quad \{\bot,\top\}$$ or $$\{F,T\}$$ or $$\{0,1\}$$
- $$\mathbb{N}$$ is the set of natural numbers     
  $$\quad \mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}$$
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is the set of integers     
  $$\quad \mathbb{Z}=\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}$$.     
- $$\mathbb{Q}$$ is the set of rational numbers     
  $$\quad \{p/q : p \in\mathbb{Z}, q\in \mathbb{N}\land q\neq 0\}$$
- $$\mathbb{R}$$ is the set of real numbers.
- $$\mathbb{C}$$ is the set of complex numbers    
  $$\quad \{a,b\,i:a,b\in\mathbb{R}\}, \quad i=\sqrt{-1}$$

Properties:
- $$\mathbb{N}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\subseteq \mathbb{Q}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$$
- $$\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$$ are __enumerable__ or **countable** infinite sets with the same cardinality. 
- $$\mathbb{R}$$ is __non-enumerable__ infinite set. It has various kinds of infinities.
- The set of positive integers: $$\mathbb{Z^+}=\{1,2,3,\dots\}$$
