# Rational numbers


A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction $$p/q$$ of two integers, a numerator $$p$$ and a non-zero denominator $$q$$. Since $$q$$ may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number.

The set of all rational numbers is denoted by $$\mathbb {Q}$$ (q for quotient).

The decimal expansion of a rational number always either:
- terminates after a finite number of digits or 
- begins to repeat the same finite sequence of digits over and over

Rationals may be build from the natural numbers by including a multiplicative inverse ($$1/n$$) for each nonzero integer $$n$$ (and also the product of these inverses by integers).
