The natural numbers are numbers used for counting and ordering. Colloquially, words used for counting are **cardinal numbers** and words used for ordering are **ordinal numbers**.

There is no concensus on whether natural numbers start with zero or one. In math, they usually start with one, while in CS, they almost exclusively start with zero.

The natural numbers are the basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension:
- **integers** by including (if absent) the neutral element $$0$$ and an additive inverse ($$âˆ’n$$) for each nonzero natural number $$n$$
- **rationals** by including a multiplicative inverse ($$1/n$$) for each nonzero integer $$n$$ (and also the product of these inverses by integers)
- **reals** by including with the rationals the limits of (converging) Cauchy sequences of rationals
- **complex numbers** by including with the real numbers the unresolved $$\sqrt{-1}$$ (and also the sums and products thereof)

These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded in the other number systems.

Properties of the natural numbers, such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers, are studied in **number theory**.

Problems concerning counting and ordering, such as partitioning and enumerations, are studied in **combinatorics**.


In XIX century, philosophical discussion about the exact nature of the natural numbers started to take place.

Frege initially defined natural number in terms of set theory as the class of all sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular set. This definition turned out to lead to paradoxes, so it had to be modified by defining a natural number as a particular set, and any set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with that set is said to have that number of elements.

The second class of definitions was introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce, refined by Richard Dedekind, and further explored by Giuseppe Peano; this approach is now called **Peano arithmetic**. It is based on an axiomatization of the properties of ordinal numbers: each natural number has a successor and every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor.

With all these definitions it is convenient to include 0 (corresponding to the empty set) as a natural number. Including 0 is now the common convention among set theorists and logicians.


## Notation

The set of natural numbers is denoted by $$\mathbb N$$. It is a countably infinite set, which can also be expressed by saying that the cardinality of the natural numbers set is aleph-naught, denoted by $$\aleph_0$$ (read aleph-naught or aleph-zero).

To be explicit about inclusion of zero an index or superscript is added: $$\mathbb N_0$$ or $$\mathbb N^0$$. Similarly to denote that zero is excluded: $$\mathbb N^*$$ or $$\mathbb N^+$$ or $$\mathbb N_1$$ or $$\mathbb N_{>0}$$
