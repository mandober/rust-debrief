# Discrete Mathematics

Mathematics can be broadly classified into two categories:
- Continuous mathematics
- Discrete mathematics

__Continuous Mathematics__ (CM)    
studies continuous changes, it is based on continuous number line of real numbers; characterized by the fact that between any two numbers, there is an infinite set of numbers. For example, in continuous mathematics a function can be plotted as a smooth curve.

__Discrete Mathematics__ (DM)     
Discrete math studies the mathematical objects that are descrete, separate, enumerable. Since computers operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits, DM studies the concepts and problems, often overlapping with studies of logic and CS, such as algorithms, algorithmic complexity, proofs, formal language, automata, computability, correctness of programming languages, automated and assisted theorem proving.
