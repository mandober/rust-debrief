Foundations of mathematics is the investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics. It can be regarded as the study of the basic mathematical concepts, and the way they form more complex ones, especially the fundamentally important concepts that form the language of mathematics such as formulas, theories, models, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc. The search for foundations of mathematics is the central question of the philosophy of mathematics - the quest for holy grail.

The foundation of a mathematical field normaly refers to an analysis of the most fundamental concepts within that field, an investigation into opportunities to turn that study into a coherent body of knowledge and integrate it with the rest of our knowledge.

The search for the foundations of mathematics came about very late in the course of math development, at the end of the XIX century


, forming a new field called mathematical logic. It went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the XX century as a large and coherent body of mathematical knowledge with several aspects or components (set theory, model theory, proof theory, etc.), whose detailed properties and possible variants are still an active research field. Its high level of technical sophistication inspired many philosophers to conjecture that it can serve as a model or pattern for the foundations of other sciences.

Mathematics is the study of systems of elementary objects, whose only considered nature is to be exact and unambiguous. Objects of such systems are inspired by the objective material world, but they exist in an idealized platonic world, where a line streches infinitely and it has no width.

Mathematics is divided into various fields, each with its own governing framework, and each formalized in an axiomatic theory. Each theory studies a supposedly fixed system of objects, called its model, but each model within a theory is just one of many possible, equally legitimate, interpretations.

Mathematical logic is a field of math preoccupied with math foundations, and like any other field, it studies theorems about a system of objects, only this time the objects are theorems themselves and the system is the whole of math.

Unlike other theories that progress from a supposedly correct foundation, math logic does not look for a fixed starting point, but a wide area composed of easier and harder steps
