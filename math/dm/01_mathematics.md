# Mathematics

Mathematics can be broadly classified into two categories: continuous and discrete mathematics.

**Continuous Mathematics** (CM) is based on continuous number line of real numbers; characterized by the fact that between any two numbers, there is an infinite set of numbers. For example, in continuous mathematics a function can be plotted as a smooth curve.

**Discrete Mathematics** (DM) studies mathematical objects that are discrete, separate, enumerable. Since computers operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits, DM studies computing concepts, overlapping with CS, such as those related to algorithms, algorithmic complexity, proofs, formal language, automata, computability, correctness of programming languages, automated and assisted theorem proving, and similar.


## Foundations of mathematics

Foundation of a mathematical field refers to an analysis of the most fundamental concepts within that field, an investigation into ways to turn that study into a coherent body of knowledge and integrate it with the rest of knowledge.

Foundation of mathematics itself is the investigation of what underlies the philosophical theories concerning the nature of mathematics; it can be regarded as the study of the basic mathematical concepts and the way they progress in complexity, especially the fundamentally important concepts that form the language of mathematics such as formulas, theories, models, definitions, proofs, algorithms, and similar. The search for this foundations is the central question of the philosophy of mathematics.

The search for the foundations of mathematics came about very late in the course of math development, at the end of the XIX century, resulting in a new field called of math called **mathematical logic**.

Like other math branches, mathematical logic studies theorems about a system of objects, only the objects are theorems themselves and the system is the whole of math.

The search for theory that will serve as the foundations of all math went through a series of crises with paradoxical results, until the discoveries stabilized during the XX century, putting forward a ZFC set theory as the main pretender for the title. Later, a challenger in the form of category theory emerged drawing significant support, but still, to this day, the champion is undecided (decidability as leitmotif). Even the turtles get weary.
