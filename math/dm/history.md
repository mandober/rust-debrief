# History

- BCE: **Aristotle**, the roots of formalised logic
- 1860s **Hermann Grassmann** showed that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the successor operation and induction.
- 1879: **Frege**'s _Begriffsschrift_ introduces propositional and predicate calculus
- 1881, **C.S.Peirce** provided Axiomatization of Natural Number Arithmetic (ANNA)
- 1884: **Frege**'s _Foundations of Arithmetic_, math in formal logic
- 1888: **Richard Dedekind** another proposal for ANNA
- 1889: **G.Peano** published a simplified version of Dedekind's ANNA proposal as a collection of axioms in his book, _The Principles of Arithmetic Presented by a New Method_.
- 1900: At the _International Congress of Mathematicians_ in Paris **David Hilbert** sets a plan to formalize math and establish completness, consistency and decidability, presents 23 math problems.
- 1903: **Frege**'s _Begriffsschrift_ reprint with Russell's paradox
- 1906: **Bertrand Russell** _The Theory of Implication_: gave a different complete axiomatization of propositional logic
- 1908: **E.Zermelo** proposes the first axiomatic set theory, Zermelo set theory
- 1909: Truth tables appear explicitly in writings by **Eugen Müller**
- 1912: **C.I.Lewis**, traces of modal propositional logic
- 1913: _Principia Mathematica_ by **Russell and Whitehead**
- 1913: **H.M.Sheffer**, define all logic operators in terms of one (NAND)
- 1917: **Jean Nicod**, axiomatize propositional logic using the Sheffer stroke and only a single axiom schema and single inference rule.
- 1917: **Jan Łukasiewicz**, three-valued propositional logic
- 1921: **Emil Post** uses truth tables extensively
- 1921: **Ludwig Wittgenstein** _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_, in which truth tables and truth-functionality are prominently featured.
- 1926: **Ernst Mally**, deontic logic
- 1927: Second edition of _Principia Mathematica_, deriving math truth using axioms, inference rules of formal logic
- 1920: Löwenheim–Skolem theorem
- 1930: Herbrand universe, Herbrand interpretation, reduction of FOL's SAT formulas to propositional SAT problems.
- 1929: **K.Gödel**'s Completeness theorem. **Presburger**: theory of natural numbers is decidable, algorithm to determine proposition's truth value
- 1930: **D.Hilbert** in Konigsberg: "_Wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen_"
- 1931: **K.Göde**l's Incompleteness theorem, Entscheidungsproblem
- 1936: **A.Church**, lambda calculus, Church–Rosser theorem proved
- 1936: **A.Church** and **A.Turing** independently showed that a general solution to the decision problem is impossible.
- 1946: ENIAC computer
- 1960: **Jaakko Hintikka**, first systematic treatment of epistemic logic
- 1970s: **A.R.Anderson**, **N.D.Belnap**, relevance propositional logic
- 1970-80: **N.C.A.da Costa**, **Graham Priest**, paraconsistent logic
