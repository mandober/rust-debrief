**Mathematical object** is anything that can be formally defined and used in deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Common mathematical objects include numbers, permutations, combinations, partitions, groups, rings, fields, lattices, sets, functions, relations, categories, proofs, theorems. In modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects are defined in terms of sets.

**Mathematical structure** on a set is an additional mathematical object that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set to endow it with some additional meaning or significance. Common mathematical structures include groups, fields, rings, orders, equivalence relations, geometries, topology, categories.

Of special interest are mappings between sets which preserve structures, so that structures in the domain are mapped to equivalent structures in the codomain:
- **homomorphisms** preserve algebraic structures
- **homeomorphisms** preserve topological structures
- **diffeomorphisms** preserve differential structures


**Mathematical space**, or universe, is a set with an additional structure.
