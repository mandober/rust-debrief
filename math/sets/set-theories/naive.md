# Naive Set Theory



Naïve (unformalized) set theory describes the aspects of mathematical sets informally, using natural language. The words `and`, `or`, `if ... then`, `not`, `for some`, `for every` are treated as in ordinary mathematics.

Naïve set theory is an approach to set theory which assumes the existence of a universal set, despite the fact that such an assumption leads to paradoxes.

It is founded upon the rigid set of axioms of propositional and predicate logic.

As a matter of convenience, use of naïve set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics – including in more formal settings of set theory itself.


The first development of set theory was a naïve set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th century by Georg Cantor as part of his study of infinite sets and developed by Gottlob Frege in his `Begriffsschrift`.

Naïve set theory may refer to several very distinct notions. It may refer to:
- __Informal presentation of an axiomatic set theory__     
  e.g. as in "Naïve Set Theory" by Paul Halmos.
- __Early or later versions of Cantor's theory__ and other informal systems.
- __Decidedly inconsistent theories__ (axiomatic or not)    
  such as a theory of Frege that yielded Russell's paradox, and 
  theories of Peano and Dedekind.


The assumption that any property may be used to form a set, without restriction, leads to paradoxes. Thus consistent systems of naïve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.


## Cantor's set theory
Some believe that Georg Cantor's set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes (see Frápolli 1991).

One difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system.

By 1899, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory, for instance Cantor's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox, and did not believe that they discredited his theory.

Cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above (false) assumption using for P(x) "x is a cardinal number".

Frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of naïve set theory can be interpreted, and it is this formal theory which Bertrand Russell actually addressed when he presented his paradox, not necessarily a theory Cantor, who, as mentioned, was aware of several paradoxes, presumably had in mind.
