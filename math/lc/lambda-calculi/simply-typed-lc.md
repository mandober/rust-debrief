# Simply typed lambda calculus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus


The simply typed lambda calculus, $$\lambda ^{\to }$$, a form of type theory, is a typed interpretation of the lambda calculus with only one type constructor: $$\to$$ that builds function types. It is the canonical and simplest example of a typed lambda calculus. 

The term simple type is also used to refer to extensions of the simply typed lambda calculus such as `products`, `coproducts` or `natural numbers` (`System T`) or even `full recursion` (like `PCF`).

In contrast, systems which introduce `polymorphic types` (like `System F`) or `dependent types` (like the `Logical Framework`) are not considered simply typed.

The former, except full recursion, are still considered simple because the Church encodings of such structures can be done using only $$\to$$ and suitable type variables, while polymorphism and dependency cannot.
