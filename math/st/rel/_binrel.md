# Binary relations

- equivalence relation: symmetric, transitive, reflexive
- partial equivalence: symmetric, transitive


## List of properties
Important properties that a binary relation may have include:
- reflexivity, irreflexivity, coreflexivity
- symmetry, antisymmetry, asymmetry
- transitivity
- totality
- right Euclidean, left Euclidean, Euclidean
- trichotomy, serial properties, set-like properties


## List of relations
List of some relations by properties
- **equivalence**: reflexive, symmetric, transitive.
- **partial equivalence**: symmetric, transitive.
- **reflexive**: symmetric, transitive, serial.
- **partial order**: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive.
- **total order** (linear order, or chain): partial order that is total.
- **well-order**: linear order where every nonempty subset has a least element.



## total
This definition for total is different from left total. 
For example, `>=` is a total relation.

## trichotomous
For example, `>` is a trichotomous relation, while the relation "divides" on natural numbers is not.

## Euclidean
A Euclidean relation is both left and right Euclidean. Equality is a Euclidean relation because if `x=y` and `x=z`, then `y=z`.

## serial
"Is greater than" is a serial relation on the integers.
But it is not a serial relation on the positive integers, because there is no `y` in the positive integers such that `1 > y`. 
However, "is less than" is a serial relation on the positive integers, the rational numbers and the real numbers.

Every reflexive relation is serial: for a given `x`, choose `y = x`.
A serial relation can be equivalently characterized as every element having a non-empty successor neighborhood. Similarly an inverse serial relation is a relation in which every element has non-empty predecessor neighborhood.

## set-like (or local)
The usual ordering `<` on the class of ordinal numbers is set-like, while its inverse `>` is not.





## Partial equivalence relation
A partial equivalence relation (PER) `R` on a set `X` is a relation that is _symmetric_ and _transitive_.

It holds for all `a, b, c ∈ X` that:
1. if `aRb`, then `bRa` (symmetry)
2. if `aRb` and `bRc`, then `aRc` (transitivity)

If `R` is also reflexive, then `R` is an equivalence relation.
