> An equivalence relation is a binary relation that is at the same time reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

As a consequence of these properties an equivalence relation provides a _partition_ of a set into __equivalence classes__.

Notation: two elements `a` and `b` of a set are equivalent with respect to an equivalence relation `R`: `a ~ b` and `a ≡ b`, which are used when `R` is the obvious relation being referenced, and variations of `a ~R b`, `a ≡R b` or `a R b` otherwise.

Definition: A given binary relation `~` on a set `X` is said to be an equivalence relation if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. 

That is, for all `a`, `b` and `c` in `X`:
- Reflexivity: `a ~ a`
- Symmetry: `a ~ b` if and only if `b ~ a`
- Transitivity: if `a ~ b` and `b ~ c` then `a ~ c`
`X` together with the relation `~` is called a setoid. The equivalence class of `a` under `~`, denoted `[a]`, is defined as: 
`[a] = {b ∈ X | a ~ b }`



A relation is an **equivalence relation** if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Example
The relation R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2),(1,3),(3,1)} on set A={1,2,3} is an equivalence relation since it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
