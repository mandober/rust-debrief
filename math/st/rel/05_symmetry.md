# Symmetry

A binary relation $$R$$ over a set $$X$$ is symmetric if it holds for all $$a$$ and $$b$$ in $$X$$ that $$a$$ is related to $$b$$ if and only if $$b$$ is related to $$a$$.

Formal definition: $$∀a,b ∈ X (aRb ⇔ bRa)$$



A relation R ⊆ X2 is symmetric iff, whenever Rxy, then also Ryx.

**Anti-symmetry**
A relation R ⊆ X2 is anti-symmetric iff, whenever both Rxy and Ryx, then x = y (or, in other words: if x 6= y then either :Rxy or :Ryx).




**Symmetric** relation R on set A is called Symmetric if xRy implies yRx, ∀x∈A and ∀y∈A.
Example
The relation R={(1,2),(2,1),(3,2),(2,3)} on set A={1,2,3} is symmetric.

**Antisymmetric**
relation R on set A is called Anti-Symmetric if xRy and yRx implies x=y∀x∈A and ∀y∈A.
Example
The relation R={(x,y)→N|x≤y} is anti-symmetric since x≤y and y≤x implies x=y.



## symmetric
"Is a blood relative of" is a symmetric relation, because x is a blood relative of y if and only if y is a blood relative of x.

## antisymmetric
For example, $$>=$$ is anti-symmetric; so is $$>$$, but vacuously (the condition in the definition is always false).

## asymmetric
A relation is asymmetric if and only if it is both anti-symmetric and irreflexive. For example, $$>$$ is asymmetric, but $$>=$$ is not.
