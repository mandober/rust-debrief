# Partially ordered set

A partially ordered set (poset) consists of a set together with a binary relation indicating that, for certain pairs of elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other in the ordering. It is called partial to indicate that not every pair of elements need be comparable (some pairs of elements may exist where neither element precedes the other). Partial orders are a generalization of total orders, in which every pair must be comparable.

To qualify as a partial order, a binary relation must be:
- **reflexive** (each element is comparable to itself)
- **antisymmetric** (no two different elements precede each other)
- **transitive** (the start of a chain of precedence relations must precede the end of the chain)

In a poset $$P$$, the **join** of a subset $$S$$ is the **supremum** or **least upper bound** (LUB) of $$S$$, denoted $$\lor S$$.

In a poset $$P$$, the **meet** of a subset $$S$$ is the **infimum** or **greatest lower bound** (GLB) of $$S$$, denoted $$\land S$$.

In general, the join and meet of a subset of a poset need not exist, but when they do, they are elements of $$P$$.
