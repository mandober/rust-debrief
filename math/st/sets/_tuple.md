- a set contining no elements is the **empty** set.
- a set containing 1 element is a **singleton** set, or unit set
- a set containing 2 elements is a **pair**, unordered pair, 2-tuple
- a set containing $$k$$ elements is a **k-tuple**

A set $$X$$ is called an __ordered pair__ if $$X = \{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}$$ for some $$x,y$$. This is commonly abbreviated by writing an ordered pair as $$\langle x,y \rangle$$ or $$\{(x,y)\}$$.

Two ordered pairs are equal if their respective components are the same: let $$(a, b)$$ and $$(c, d)$$ be ordered pairs; then $$(a, b) = (c, d)$$ iff $$a = c$$ and $$b = d$$.

An ordered pair $$\langle x, x \rangle$$ is $$\{\{x\},\{x, x\}\}$$ by definition, which first collapses into $$\{\{x\},\{x\}\}$$ and then into $$\{\{x\}\}$$. Therefore $$\langle x, x \rangle = \{\{x\}\}$$.
