# Cardinality

- Cardinality of a set $$X$$ is the number of elements it contains, denoted by $$|X|$$.
- This number is referred to as the cardinal number, $$\mathfrak{c}$$.
- Countable set has its elements in a 1-1 correspondence with $$\mathbb{N}$$
- Two sets are equal iff they contain the same elements.
- Two sets are equivalent iff they have the same cardinality.
- Singleton or unit set is a set containing a single element.
- Unordered pair is a set containing two elements.
- Cardinality of a power set of a set $$X$$ is $$2^{|X|}$$.
- Cardinality of a power set of an empty set is: $$\mathcal{P}(\varnothing)=1$$.
- Cardinality of a set $$X$$ is equivalent to $$\mathbb{N}$$ if there is a bijective function, $$f:\mathbb{N} \mapsto X$$, mapping elements in $$\mathbb{N}$$ to the elements in $$X$$
