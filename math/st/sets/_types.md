## Cardinality

Cardinality of a set S, denoted by |S|, is the number of elements of the set. The number is also referred as the cardinal number. If a set has an infinite number of elements, its cardinality is ∞.
|{1,2,3,4,5,…}| = ∞

|X|=|Y| denotes two sets X and Y having same cardinality.
It occurs when the number of elements in X is exactly equal to the number of elements in Y. In this case, there exists a __bijective__ function `f` from X to Y.

|X|≤|Y| denotes that set X’s cardinality is less than or equal to set Y’s cardinality. It occurs when number of elements in X is less than or equal to that of Y. Here, there exists an __injective__ function ‘f’ from X to Y.

|X|<|Y| denotes that set X’s cardinality is less than set Y’s cardinality. It occurs when number of elements in X is less than that of Y. Here, the function ‘f’ from X to Y is _injective function but not bijective_.

If |X|≤|Y| and |X|≥|Y| then |X|=|Y|. The sets X and Y are commonly referred as _equivalent_ sets.


## Types of Sets

Sets can be classified into many types, including: finite, infinite, universal, singleton, empty set.

__Proper Subset__
A Set X is a proper subset of set Y (Written as X⊂Y) if every element of X is an element of set Y and |X|<|Y|.

X={1,2,3,4,5,6} and Y={1,2}.
Here set Y⊂X since all elements in Y are contained in X too and X has at least one element is more than set Y.

__Universal Set__
It is a collection of all elements in a particular context or application. All the sets in that context or application are essentially subsets of this universal set. Universal sets are represented as U.

Example − We may define U as the set of all animals on earth. In this case, set of all mammals is a subset of U, set of all fishes is a subset of U, set of all insects is a subset of U, and so on.

__Singleton Set__ or __Unit Set__
Singleton set or unit set contains only one element. A singleton set is denoted by {s}.
Example − S={x|x∈N, 7<x<9} = {8}

__Equal Set__
If two sets contain the same elements they are said to be equal.
Example − If A={1,2,6} and B={6,1,2}, they are equal as every element of set A is an element of set B and every element of set B is an element of set A.

__Equivalent Set__
If the cardinalities of two sets are same, they are called equivalent sets.
Example − If A={1,2,6} and B={16,17,22}, they are equivalent as cardinality of A is equal to the cardinality of B. i.e. |A|=|B|=3

__Overlapping Set__
Two sets that have at least one common element are called overlapping sets.
In case of overlapping sets −
n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)−n(A∩B)
n(A∪B)=n(A−B)+n(B−A)+n(A∩B)
n(A)=n(A−B)+n(A∩B)
n(B)=n(B−A)+n(A∩B)
Example − Let, A={1,2,6} and B={6,12,42}. There is a common element ‘6’, hence these sets are overlapping sets.

__Disjoint Set__
Two sets A and B are called disjoint sets if they do not have even one element in common. Therefore, disjoint sets have the following properties −
n(A∩B)=∅
n(A∪B)=n(A)+n(B)
Example − Let, A={1,2,6} and B={7,9,14}, there is not a single common element, hence these sets are overlapping sets.

__Power set__
of a set S is the set of all subsets of S including the empty set. The cardinality of a power set of a set S of cardinality n is 2^n


## Set Operations
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Complement
- Cartesian (cross) product


## Partitioning

Partition of a set, say S, is a collection of n disjoint subsets, say P1,P2,…Pn that satisfies the following three conditions −

Pi does not contain the empty set.

[Pi≠{∅} for all 0<i≤n]
The union of the subsets must equal the entire original set.

[P1∪P2∪⋯∪Pn=S]
The intersection of any two distinct sets is empty.

[Pa∩Pb={∅}, for a≠b where n≥a,b≥0]
Example

Let S={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}
One probable partitioning is {a},{b,c,d},{e,f,g,h}
Another probable partitioning is {a,b},{c,d},{e,f,g,h}


## Bell Numbers
Bell numbers give the count of the number of ways to partition a set. They are denoted by Bn where n is the cardinality of the set.

Example −

Let S={1,2,3}, n=|S|=3
The alternate partitions are −

1. ∅,{1,2,3}
2. {1},{2,3}
3. {1,2},{3}
4. {1,3},{2}
5. {1},{2},{3}

Hence B3=5
