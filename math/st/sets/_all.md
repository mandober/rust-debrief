## Partitioning
Partition of a set, S, is a collection of n disjoint subsets, P1,P2,…Pn, that satisfies the following three conditions:

- Pi does not contain the empty set.
  `[Pi≠{∅} for all 0<i≤n]`
- The union of the subsets must equal the entire original set.
  `[P1∪P2∪⋯∪Pn=S]`
- The intersection of any two distinct sets is empty.
  `[Pa∩Pb={∅}, for a≠b where n≥a,b≥0]`

Example:
Let S={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}
One probable partitioning scheme: {a},{b,c,d},{e,f,g,h}
Another probable partitioning scheme: {a,b},{c,d},{e,f,g,h}

**Bell number** signifies the number of ways to partition a set; it is denoted by $$B_n$$, where $$n$$ is the cardinality of the set. For example, let $$S=\{1,2,3\},\ \ n=|S|=3$$.

The partitions:
1. $$\{\},\{1,2,3\}$$
2. $$\{1\},\{2,3\}$$
3. $$\{1,2\},\{3\}$$
4. $$\{1,3\},\{2\}$$
5. $$\{1\},\{2\},\{3\}$$

so, $$B_3=5$$
