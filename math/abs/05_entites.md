**Primitive notion** is an undefined concept, not defined in terms of previously defined concepts, to be taken for granted. It lacks a proof, and in that regard it's analogous to an axiom of a formal system (axioms don't require proof). Sometimes the primitive notions cannot be avoided because we need to start somewhere lest regress into downward spiral of definitions, forever defining concept in terms of previously defined concept, which also need definition in terms of previous ones, and so on, ad nauseum. And sometimes a concept just doesn't have a formal definition (e.g. "set", "space").

**Mathematical space** is a universe (universal set) with some added structure. While modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as Euclidean spaces, linear spaces, topological spaces, Hilbert spaces, probability spaces, it doesn't define the notion of "space" itself.

**Mathematical object** is anything that can be formally defined and used in deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Common objects include numbers, permutations, combinations, partitions, functions, relations, proofs, theorems. In modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects are defined in terms of sets.

A **set** is is an unordered collection of distinct mathematical objects that share a common property. Despite the fact that sets are the basis of mathematics, with nearly all mathematical objects resembling a set of some kind, the term "set" doesn't have a formal definition.

**Mathematical structure** on a set is an additional structural object that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set, endowing it with some extra meaning or significance. Structure-preserving relations map structures in domain to equivalent structures in codomain: **homomorphisms** preserve algebraic structures, **homeomorphisms** preserve topological structures, **diffeomorphisms** preserve differential structures.

## Algebraic structures

**Algebraic structure** on a set $$A$$, called **carrier set** or **underlying set**, is a set of finitary operations on $$A$$; the set $$A$$ with this additional structure is also called an **algebra**.

More complex structures (e.g. vector spaces, modules, algebras) can be defined by introducing multiple operations, different underlying sets or defining axioms.

The properties of specific algebraic structures are studied in **abstract algebra**. The general theory of algebraic structures has been formalized in **universal algebra**. The language of **category theory** is used to express and study relationships between different classes of algebraic and non-algebraic objects.

Some algebraic structures with one or more operations that obey a particular set of laws, have names.

## Group
A group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any 2 elements to form a new group element, satisfying all 4 group axioms:
1. Closure
1. Associativity
1. Identity
1. Invertibility

## Abelian group
Abelian or a commutative group is a group that also satifies the axiom of commutativity, so the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the application order. Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers.
1. Closure
1. Associativity
1. Identity
1. Invertibility
1. Commutativity

## Lattice
A lattice is an abstract structure consisting of a **poset** in which every two elements have a unique supremum (least upper bound or **join**) and a unique infimum (greatest lower bound or **meet**). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.

### Field
A field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined, and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do. A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.

### Ordered field
In mathematics, an ordered field is a field together with a total ordering of its elements that is compatible with the field operations. Historically, the axiomatization of an ordered field was abstracted gradually from the real numbers, by mathematicians including David Hilbert, Otto HÃ¶lder and Hans Hahn.

### Lie group
In mathematics, a Lie group (pronounced "Lee") is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, with the property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups.

### Topological group
In mathematics, a topological group is a group G together with a topology on G such that the group's binary operation and the group's inverse function are continuous functions with respect to the topology. A topological group is a mathematical object with both an algebraic structure and a topological structure.
