# Discrete Mathematics

Mathematics can be broadly classified into two categories: continuous and discrete mathematics.

**Continuous Mathematics** (CM) is based on continuous number line of real numbers; characterized by the fact that between any two numbers, there is an infinite set of numbers. For example, in continuous mathematics a function can be plotted as a smooth curve.

**Discrete Mathematics** (DM) studies mathematical objects that are discrete, separate, enumerable. Since computers operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits, DM studies computing concepts, overlapping with CS, such as those related to algorithms, algorithmic complexity, proofs, formal language, automata, computability, correctness of programming languages, automated and assisted theorem proving, and similar.
