# Mathematics

Mathematics (Greek μάθημα máthēma, "knowledge, study, learning") includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.

Mathematicians seek patterns to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by providing a mathematical proof through rigorous argumentation.

Ancient Greeks have pioneered the rigorous argumentation; namely, Aristotle laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems.

This method reached its peek with Euclid of Alexandria - his book _Elements_ from c. 300 BCE featured theorems (of what is now called Euclidean geometry) that were all deduced from a small set of axioms. Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms, showcasing excellence in rigor that set the standard for the future.

> _Elements_ is one of the most influential works ever, not only in mathematics, serving as the textbook for teaching geometry, from the time of publication until the early XX century.

The progress of math was relatively slow until the Renaissance, when mathematical innovations reinvigorated its development. In the late XIX century, it became customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from a set of axioms and definitions. This prompted a German mathematician David Hilbert to propose a research into the foundations of mathematics.

The foundation of a mathematical field refers to an analysis of the most fundamental concepts within a field, an investigation into ways to turn that study into a coherent body of knowledge and integrate it with the rest of human knowledge. The **foundation of mathematics** can be regarded as the study of the basic mathematical concepts, especially the fundamental ones that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories, models, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.).

The search for the foundations of mathematics came about very late in the course of math development, at the end of the XIX century, when some aspects of math were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies.

In 1900, at the international conference in Paris, Hilbert showcased a collection of 23 mathematical problems, known as **Hilbert's program**, in connection with the search for foundations. Hilbert wanted to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, providing a proof that these axioms were consistent.

Hilbert's challenge was in response to the **foundational crisis of mathematics** that emerged at the turn of the century, as a consequence of discovered inconsistencies and paradoxes in prevailing mathematical theories.

The search for theory that will serve as the foundations of all math settled down during the XX century, putting forward a ZF set theory as the main pretender for this title. Recently, a new challenger in the form of category theory has emerged, drawing in significant support, but still, to this day, the champion is undecided (decidability as leitmotif). Even the turtles get weary.
