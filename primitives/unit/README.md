# Unit type

* name: common: unit type, nominal: without nominal name
* annotation: `()`
* cardinality: 1
* value: `()`  
* literal: ✔  
* std::module: ✗  
* sample: `fn empty(is: bool) -> ()`  


Unit is a type that allows only one value, therefore it cannot hold information.

It may also be regarded as the empty tuple, i.e. the product of no types. 

Several computer programming languages provide a unit type to specify the return type of a function that returns nothing, and the argument type of a function that does not require arguments.

Unit type to type theory is what number one is in algebra when operation is mutiplication: any number multipled by one results in itself. 


Algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, a type formed by combining other types. Two common classes of algebraic types are *product* types and *sum* types. These types get their name from math, from algebra, whose operations such as addition and multiplication operate on numbers, while in type theory they operate on types, giving sum and product types, respectively.

With numbers, two numbers are added to make a third; with types, two types are added to make a third, a sum type. For example, If b is a boolean (having 2 possible values, true or false) and u is a unit type (having only 1 possible value, usually denoted as `()`),


A boolean is the set {true, false}.
An 8-bit unsigned integer is the set {0,1,2,...,255}.
A string is a set with infinite elements, containing all possible valid strings.
