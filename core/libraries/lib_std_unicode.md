Crate `std_unicode`

ðŸ”¬ This is a nightly-only experimental API. (unicode #27783)

The Unicode Library
Unicode-intensive functions for char and `str` types.

This crate provides a collection of Unicode-related functionality, including 
decompositions, conversions, etc., and provides traits implementing these 
functions for the char and `str` types.

The functionality included here is only that which is necessary to provide for 
basic string-related manipulations. This crate does not (yet) aim to provide a 
full set of Unicode tables.
