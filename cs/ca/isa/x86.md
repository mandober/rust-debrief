# x86 

- 32-bit (4B) general-purpose processor registers (GPR) (eg. EAX, EBX)
- 32-bit integer arithmetic and logical operations
- 32-bit offsets within a segment in protected mode
- 32-bit strides default for push and pop on the stack
- 32-bit wide non-segmented pointers
- 36-bit physical addresses with PAE, with 32-bit linear address size
- translation of segmented addresses to 32-bit linear addresses
- 48-bit segmented address format: 16-bit segment number, 32-bit segment offset
- byte-addressable
