## Computer architecture

**Computer architecture** is the basic operational design of a computer system.

John von Neumann, a pioneer in computer design, is given credit for the principal computer architecture in use today.

The popular 80x86 family uses the von Neumann architecture (VNA).

Von Neumann architecture has 3 major components:
1. CPU - Central Processing Unit
2. Memory
3. I/O - Input/Output
