Virtual memory system abstracts the memory management by mapping memory addresses, used by a program (virtual addresses) into physical addresses in RAM. This increases security by isolating the processes from each other and provides extended space, beyond the physically available RAM, through paging and swapping techniques.

The OS manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. The A CPU has memory management unit (MMU) for automatic virtual to physical address translation. The program sees the memory as a vast contiguous address space, his happy place.


## Shared memory

In computer science, shared memory is memory that may be simultaneously accessed by multiple programs with an intent to provide communication among them or avoid redundant copies. Shared memory is an efficient means of passing data between programs. Depending on context, programs may run on a single processor or on multiple separate processors.

Using memory for communication inside a single program, e.g. among its multiple threads, is also referred to as shared memory.
