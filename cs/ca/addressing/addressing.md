# Addressing

An **address space** defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which corresponds to a memory location, disk sector, peripheral device, host on a network or other logical or physical entities.


An address space defines a range of discrete addresses, each of which corresponds to a location (in memory).

Mapping and translation is used by memory address space to form memory layers.

Memory layers are used to allow strict control over memory access and usage, and to increase memory safety and overall security.

This means that a higher-level (virtual) address is distributed to memory consumers, so it must be translated to a lower-level (physical) memory address.
