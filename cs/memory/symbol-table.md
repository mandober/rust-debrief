https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Symbol_table

A symbol table is a data structure used by a compiler where each identifier in a program's source code is associated with information relating to its declaration or appearance in the source.

A symbol table only exist in memory during the compilation phase, although it may be embedded in the output, e.g. in ABI object file for dubugging purposes.
