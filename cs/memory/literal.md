# Literal

- literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code.
- all languages have syntactic notation for atomic scalar values
- some languages also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects.
- An anonymous function is a literal for the function type.
- In contrast to literals, variables or constants are symbols that can take on one of a class of fixed values, the constant being constrained not to change. 
- Literals are often used to initialize variables
-  Some literals are specific keywords, like true for the boolean literal "true".
- A string literal or anonymous string is a type of literal in programming for the representation of a string value within the source code
- A few languages provide a method of specifying that a literal is to be processed without any language-specific interpretation. This avoids the need for escaping, and yields more legible strings.


Literal affixes/
While sigils are applied to names (identifiers), similar prefixes and suffixes can be applied to literals, notably integer literals and string literals, specifying either how the literal should be evaluated, or what data type it is. For example, 0x10ULL evaluates to the value 16 as an unsigned long long integer in C++: the 0x prefix indicates hexadecimal, while the suffix ULL indicates unsigned long long. Similarly, prefixes are often used to indicate a raw string, such as r"C:\Windows" in Python, which represents the string with value C:\Windows as an escaped string this would be written as "C:\\Windows".

As this affects the semantics (value) of a literal, rather than the syntax or semantics of an identifier (name), this is neither stropping (identifier syntax) nor a sigil (identifier semantics), but it is syntactically similar.
