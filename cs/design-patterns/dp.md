# Design patterns


## Behavioral

- Chain of Responsibility
  Define a method of passing a request among a chain of objects.
- Command
  Encapsulate a command request in an object.
- Interpreter
  Allow inclusion of language elements in an application.
- Iterator
  Enable sequential access to collection elements.
- Mediator
  Define simplified communication between classes.
- Memento
  Save and restore the internal state of an object.
- Observer
  Define a scheme for notifying objects of changes to another object.
- State
  Alter the behavior of an object when its state changes.
- Strategy
  Encapsulate an algorithm inside a class.
- Template Method
  Allow subclasses to redefine the steps of an algorithm.
- Visitor
  Define a new operation on a class without changing it.


## Creational

Abstract Factory
Encapsulate a set of analogous factories that produce families of objects.

Builder
Encapsulate the construction of complex objects from their representation; so, the same building process can create various representations by specifying only type and content.

Factory Method
Allow subclasses to "decide" which class to instantiate.

Prototype
Create an initialized instance for cloning or copying.

Singleton
Ensure that only a single instance of a class exists and provide a single method for gaining access to it.


## Structural

Adapter
Adapt an interface to an expected interface.

Bridge
Decouple an interface from its implementation.

Composite
Create a tree structure for part-whole hierarchies.

Decorator
Extend functionality dynamically.

Façade (Facade)
Simplify usage by defining a high-level interface.

Flyweight
Support fine-grained objects efficiently by sharing.

Proxy
Represent an object with another object for access control.
