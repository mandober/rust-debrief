# Addressability

Byte addressing refers to hardware architectures which support accessing individual bytes of data, as opposed to word-addressable machines that use word.

In computer architecture, a word is an ordered set of bytes or bits that is the normal unit in which information may be stored, transmitted, or operated on within a given computer.

If a computer's memory is word-addressable then each word in memory is assigned its own memory address. This means that the processor is able to address and fetch only complete words from the memory. Such computers are sometimes called word machines.

Typically, if a processor has a fixed-length instruction set, then the instruction length equals the word length.
