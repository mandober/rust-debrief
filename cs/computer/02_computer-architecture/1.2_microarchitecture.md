# Microarchitecture

**Microarchitecture**, or *computer organization*, defines a set of processor design techniques used in a particular processor to implement the instruction set.

Processors with different microarchitectures can share a common instruction set. For example, the Intel Pentium and the Advanced Micro Devices Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set, but have radically different internal designs.
