# Computer Architecture

The goal of computer architecture is to design a computer by maximizing its performance and reliability, while minimizing its costs and power consumption. To achieve this task, a computer architecture describes the functionality, organization and implementation of a computer system, especially considering instruction set design, logic design, optimization, packaging.

Computer Architecture:
* Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
* Microarchitecture (computer organization)
* System Design (implementation)


**Instruction Set Architecture** (ISA) defines the instructions, in the form of machine code that a CPU can understand, machine's word size, memory address modes, processor registers and available data types.

**Microarchitecture**, or *computer organization*, defines a set of processor design techniques used in a particular processor to implement the instruction set.

**System Design** defines the remaining elements in a computer system: non-CPU data processing such as direct memory access (DMA), along with other concepts such as virtualization, multiprocessing, software features.
