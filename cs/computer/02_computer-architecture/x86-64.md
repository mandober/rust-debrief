x86-64 ISA
- 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set
- 2^64 bits virtual and physical memory space
- 2^64 bits (16 EB) max memory size
- 64-bit virtual addresses
- 48-bit physical addresses, gives 256 TB
- 64-bit GPRs (eg. RAX, RBX)
- 64-bit pointers
- 64-bit integer arithmetic and logical operations
- 64-bit strides are default for push and pop on the stack

Even though 64 bits are available, not all of them are used.
- 40-bit physical addresses could address up to 1 TB of RAM. (Original plan)
- 48-bit can address 256 TB of RAM. (Currently in use)
- 52-bit can address 4 PB of RAM. (Possible future extension)
- 64-bit maximum, could address 16 EB of RAM. (Eventually)


x86 ISA
- 32-bit (4B) general-purpose processor registers (GPR) (eg. EAX, EBX)
- 32-bit integer arithmetic and logical operations
- 32-bit offsets within a segment in protected mode
- 32-bit strides default for push and pop on the stack
- 32-bit wide non-segmented pointers
- 36-bit physical addresses with PAE, with 32-bit linear address size
- translation of segmented addresses to 32-bit linear addresses
- 48-bit segmented address format: 16-bit segment number, 32-bit segment offset
- byte-addressable
