# Electronic components

**Electronics** encompasses all the fields of science interested in emission, flow and control of electrons in an electronic system. It was established with the discovery of electron in 1897, followed by the invention of vacuum tube, that allowed amplification and rectification of *electrical signals*.

**Electronic components** are any discrete physical devices in an electronic system affecting electrons and their fields. They have a number of *electrical connectors* used to join different components, creating an *electrical circuit* with a specific function.

**Electrical elements**, on the other hand, are abstractions that represent idealized electronic components.

**Transistor**, the XX century's invention that replaced vacuum tubes, is a semiconductor used for switching and amplification in an electric circuit.

**Integrated circuit** (IC) is a set of electronic circuits fit onto a single chip made out of semiconductor material (silicon).

**Application-specific integrated circuit** (ASIC) is an IC customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use.

**System on chip** (SoC) integrates all essential computer components (CPU, memory, I/O ports) on a single, compact, chip. It is made possible by the decrease in feature size of fabrication process (14nm in 2018), by fitting over 100 million logic gates on an ASIC chip.
