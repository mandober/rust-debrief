# Semiconductor

Semiconductor device fabrication is the process applied to create the integrated circuits that are present in everyday electrical and electronic devices.

It is a multiple-step sequence of _photolithographic_ and chemical processing steps during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a _wafer_ made of pure semiconducting material.

Silicon is almost always used, but various compound semiconductors are used for specialized applications.

The entire manufacturing process, from start to packaged chips ready for shipment, takes 6-8 weeks and is performed in highly specialized facilities.

In more advanced semiconductor devices (14/10/7 nm nodes) fabrication can take 11–13 weeks.

Each generation of the semiconductor manufacturing process, also known as *technology node*, is designated by the process’s minimum feature size.

Technology nodes, also known as *process technologies* or *nodes*, are typically indicated by the size in nanometers of the process's gate length.

As of 2018, 14 nanometer process chips are common in mass production, with 10 nanometer class chips about to begin production.
