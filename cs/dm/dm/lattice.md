A lattice is an abstract structure consisting of a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a unique supremum (least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (greatest lower bound or meet).

An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.
