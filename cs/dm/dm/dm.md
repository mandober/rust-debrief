# Discrete Mathematics

Mathematics can be broadly classified into two categories:
- Continuous mathematics
- Discrete mathematics

Discrete mathematics (DM) is the study of mathematical objects that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. They do not vary smoothly, but have distinct, separated values and they can often be enumerated.

However, there is no exact definition of the term "discrete mathematics"; its field of study is more described by what is excludes (continuous values) than what it includes (distinct values).

Since computers operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits, DM is applicable to studying concepts and problems in CS, such as algorithms and their complexity, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving and software development.

Subjects of interest to DM include:
- Sets
- Relations
- Functions
- Propositinal logic
- Predicate logic
- Group theory
- Order theory
- Lattice
- Counting theory
- Probability theory
- Graph theory
- Boolean algebra
