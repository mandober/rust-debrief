# Implication


If p then q, $$p\to q$$, is always true except if p is true and q is somehow false, then the overall statement is a lie (falsity). In other cases th overall statement is true:


_If it rains, the streets are wet_: $$p \to q$$
p = "raining", q = "wet streets"

1. p=1, q=1:
  _It was raining, so the streets are wet_. Overall truth value: 1.
  "Default" case. The premise is observed.
2. p=1, q=0:
  _It was raining, but the streets are NOT wet_. Overall: 0.
   Falsity. The premise was a lie.
3. p=0, q=1:
  _It was NOT raining, but the streets are wet_. Overall: 1.
4. p=0, q=0:
  _It was NOT raining, so the streets are NOT wet_. Overall: 1.
  Dry streets imply it was NOT raining.
