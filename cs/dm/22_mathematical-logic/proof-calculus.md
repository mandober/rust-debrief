# Proof calculus

A proof calculus (proof system) is built to prove statements. 

A proof system includes the components:
* **Language**: the set of formulas admitted by the system.
* **Rules of inference**: rules to prove theorems from axioms and theorems.
* **Axioms**: formulas in the language assumed to be valid. All theorems are derived from axioms.

Sequent calculus can be used to express the consequence relations of both intuitionistic logic and relevance logic. Thus, loosely speaking, a proof calculus is characterized by a certain style of formal inference that may be specialized to produce specific formal systems, namely by specifying the actual inference rules for such a system.

Widely used proof calculi
- Calculus of natural deduction
- Sequent calculus
- Hilbert-Ackermann system of FOL

Gerhard Gentzen's calculus of natural deduction was the first formalism of structural proof theory and the cornerstone of the formulae-as-types correspondence relating logic to functional programming. Gentzen's sequent calculus is the most studied formalism of structural proof theory.
