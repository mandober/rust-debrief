# Mathematical Logic


In mathematical logic, satisfiability and validity are elementary concepts of semantics.

A formula is satisfiable if it is possible to find an interpretation (model) that makes the formula true.

A formula is valid if all interpretations make the formula true.

The opposites of these concepts are unsatisfiability and invalidity.

A formula is unsatisfiable if none of the interpretations make the formula true. It is invalid if some such interpretation makes the formula false.

These 4 concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to Aristotle's square of opposition.
