# Partially ordered set

A partially ordered set (poset) consists of a set together with a binary relation indicating that, for certain pairs of elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other in the ordering. The word "partial" is used as an indication that not every pair of elements need be comparable: there may be pairs of elements for which neither element precedes the other.

Partial orders thus generalize total orders, in which every pair is comparable.
