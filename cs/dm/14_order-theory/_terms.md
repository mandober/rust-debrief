A **chain** is a totally ordered set or a totally ordered subset of a poset.

**Chain complete** is a partially ordered set in which every chain has a least upper bound.

An **antichain** is a poset in which no two elements are comparable, i.e., there are no two distinct elements x and y such that x ≤ y. In other words, the order relation of an antichain is just the identity relation.

An **antitone** function f between posets P and Q is a function for which, for all elements x, y of P, x ≤ y (in P) implies f(y) ≤ f(x) (in Q). Another name for this property is **order-reversing**.

In analysis, in the presence of total orders, such functions are often called **monotonically decreasing**, but this is not a very convenient description when dealing with non-total orders. 

The dual notion is called **monotone** or order-preserving.

A **bounded poset** is one that has a least element and a greatest element.

A poset is **bounded complete** if every of its subsets with some upper bound also has a least such upper bound. The dual notion is not common.

A **closure operator** on the poset P is a function C : P → P that is monotone, idempotent, and satisfies C(x) ≥ x for all x in P.
