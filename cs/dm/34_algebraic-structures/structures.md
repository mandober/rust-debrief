## Group
A group is an algebraic structure consisting of a set of elements equipped with an operation that combines any two elements to form a third element and satisfies all group axioms:
1. **closure**
2. **associativity**
3. **identity**
4. **invertibility**

## Abelian group
also called a commutative group, is a group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements _does not depend on the order_ in which they are written. That is, these are the groups that obey the __axiom of commutativity__. Abelian groups generalize the arithmetic of addition of integers.

## Lattice
A lattice is an abstract structure consisting of a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a unique supremum (least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (greatest lower bound or meet).

An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.


### Field
A field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined, and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers do. A field is thus a fundamental algebraic structure, which is widely used in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.

### Ordered field
In mathematics, an ordered field is a field together with a total ordering of its elements that is compatible with the field operations. Historically, the axiomatization of an ordered field was abstracted gradually from the real numbers, by mathematicians including David Hilbert, Otto HÃ¶lder and Hans Hahn.

### Lie group
In mathematics, a Lie group (pronounced "Lee") is a group that is also a differentiable manifold, with the property that the group operations are compatible with the smooth structure. Lie groups are named after Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups.

### Topological group
In mathematics, a topological group is a group G together with a topology on G such that the group's binary operation and the group's inverse function are continuous functions with respect to the topology. A topological group is a mathematical object with both an algebraic structure and a topological structure.
