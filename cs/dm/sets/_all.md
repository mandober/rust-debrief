$$\quad \mathbb{N}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}\subseteq \mathbb{Q}\subseteq \mathbb{R}$$

Even though they are all infinite sets, it turns out that $$\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$$ have the same number of elements, while $$\mathbb{R}$$ has a whole lotta more. The former three are __enumerable__ and infinite whereas the latter R is __non-enumerable__ and infinite.

## Types of Sets
- Universal set
- Singleton (unit) set
- Equal set
- Equivalent set
- Overlapping set
- Disjoint set
- Powerset


## Set Operations
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Complement
- Cartesian (cross) product
- Partitioning
- Bell Numbers


## Partitioning

Partition of a set, say S, is a collection of n disjoint subsets, say P1,P2,…Pn that satisfies the following three conditions −

Pi does not contain the empty set.

[Pi≠{∅} for all 0<i≤n]
The union of the subsets must equal the entire original set.

[P1∪P2∪⋯∪Pn=S]
The intersection of any two distinct sets is empty.

[Pa∩Pb={∅}, for a≠b where n≥a,b≥0]
Example

Let S={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}
One probable partitioning is {a},{b,c,d},{e,f,g,h}
Another probable partitioning is {a,b},{c,d},{e,f,g,h}


## Bell Numbers
Bell numbers give the count of the number of ways to partition a set. They are denoted by Bn where n is the cardinality of the set.

Example:
Let S={1,2,3}, n=|S|=3
The alternate partitions are −
1. ∅,{1,2,3}
2. {1},{2,3}
3. {1,2},{3}
4. {1,3},{2}
5. {1},{2},{3}
Hence B3=5
