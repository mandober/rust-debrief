Sets are the most fundamental building blocks of mathematical objects. Almost every mathematical object can be seen as a set of some kind. A mathematical object is an abstract object that can be formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. The theory of sets, initiated by Georg Cantor, constitutes the basis of almost all modern mathematics.

> A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, which share some common property, considered as an object in its own right.

The set concept is one of the basics so the term "set" must be accepted as a primitive notion, without formal definition. Informally, a set is a aggregate of objects, of any kind, that share a common property; their order in the set or their repetition is unconsequential.

Properties on sets play an important role for obtaining the solution. 
Following are the different properties of classical sets

Commutative Property
Having two sets A and B:
A∩B=B∩A
A∩B=B∩A

Associative Property
Having three sets A, B and C:
A∪(B∪C)=(A∪B)∪C
A∩(B∩C)=(A∩B)∩C

Distributive Property
Having three sets A, B and C: 
A∪(B∩C)=(A∪B)∩(A∪C)
A∩(B∪C)=(A∩B)∪(A∩C)

Idempotency Property
For any set A,
A∪A=A
A∩A=A

Identity Property
For set A and universal set X
A∪φ=A
A∩X=A
A∩φ=φ
A∪X=X

Transitive Property
Having three sets A, B and C
If A <= B <= C, then A <= C

Involution Property
For any set A,
A = !!A

De Morgan's Law
supports in proving tautologies and contradiction.
