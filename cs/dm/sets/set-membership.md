The objects belonging to a set are called its __elements__ or __members__.

If an element $$a$$ is in a set $$A$$, its set membership is denoted by $$a \in A$$; if not, $$a \notin A$$ is used.

Expression $$a,b \in A$$ indicates the set membership for several things at once.

The order in which the elements of a set are specified or their repetition is of no consequence with regards to sets, e.g. this is the same set: $$\{a,b,c\}=\{b,c,b,a,a\}$$

Large sets can use abbreviation in the form of ellipsis: first, enough elements to easily infer their further sequence is listed, then elipsis, followed by the __terminal member__. For example, $$\{1,2,3,...,100\}$$.

Two sets are **equal** iff they contain the same elements. Extensionality gives us a way of proving that sets are identical by showing that whenever $$x\in X$$ then also $$x\in Y$$, and whenever $$y\in Y$$ then also $$y\in X$$.

Once a set has been formed, it is a __new entity__, different from any of its elements. A set containing one element is not the same as that element alone: $$p \neq \{p\}$$.

Sets need not contain just mathematical entities as elements, anything can be a member of a set, even other sets. A set whose elements are other sets are _collections of sets_. If an element $$a$$ is in the set $$A$$ and the set $$A$$ is in the set $$\mathscr{M}$$, that doesn't mean the element $$a$$ is in the set $$\mathscr{M}$$.
