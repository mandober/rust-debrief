> If all elements of the set $$X$$ are also elements of the set $$Y$$, then $$X$$ is the __subset__ of $$Y$$, denoted by $$X \subseteq Y$$. At the same time, set $$Y$$ is a **superset** of $$X$$, denoted by $$Y \supseteq X$$.

The relation $$\subseteq$$ is the __inclusion relation__.

A set $$X$$ is a __proper subset__ of a set $$Y$$, denoted by $$X\subset Y$$ if set $$Y$$ has additional elements besides those that are also in set $$X$$. That is if every element of $$X$$ is an element of $$Y$$ and $$|X| < |Y|$$.

For example, $$X=\{1,2\}$$ and $$Y=\{1,2,3,4\}$$. Here, $$X\subseteq Y$$, but, more precisely, $$X$$ is a proper subset of $$Y$$ i.e. $$X\subset Y$$.
