A set containing two elements may be referred to as an **unordered pair**.

A set $$X$$ is called an __ordered pair__ if $$X = \{\{x\},\{x,y\}\}$$ for some $$x,y$$. It is common to abbreviate the right hand expression by writing an ordered pair as  $$\langle x,y \rangle$$ or even $$(x,y)$$.

Two ordered pairs are equal if their respective components are the same: let $$(a, b)$$ and $$(c, d)$$ be ordered pairs; then $$(a, b) = (c, d)$$ iff $$a = c$$ and $$b = d$$.
