Two sets that don't have any elements in common are called **disjoint** sets. Properties of disjoint sets:
$$A \cap B= \varnothing$$
$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$$

Two sets that have at least one common element are called **overlapping** sets. Properties of overlapping sets:
$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$$

$$|A \cup B| = |A-B| + |B-A| + |A \cap B|$$

$$|A| = |A-B| + |A \cap B|$$

$$|B| = |B-A| + |A \cap B|$$


__Universal__ set is a collection of all elements in a particular context. All the sets in that context are essentially subsets of this universal set. Universal sets are represented as $$\mathcal{U}$$.
