The concept of function was formalized at the end of the XIX century in terms of set theory, which greatly enlarged the function's domains of application. A function was defined as a special kind of relation on sets.

> A function is a relation that associates each element $$x$$ of a set $$X$$, called the **domain** of the function, to a single element $$y$$ of a set $$Y$$ (which may be the same set), called the **codomain** of the function.

If the function is called $$f$$, this relation is denoted $$f (x)=y$$; the element $$x$$ is the input parameter of the function, and $$y$$ is the output value of the function, called the **image** of $$x$$ by $$f$$.

The symbol that is used for representing the input is the variable of the function (one often says that f is a function of the variable x).

A function is uniquely represented by its graph which is the set of all pairs $$(x, f (x))$$.

When the domain and the codomain are sets of numbers, each such pair may be considered as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane. In general, these points form a curve, which is also called the graph of the function.


Formally, a function $$f$$ from a set $$X$$ to a set $$Y$$ is defined by a set $$G$$ of ordered pairs $$(x,y)$$ such that $$x \in X, y \in Y$$, and every element of $$X$$ is the first component of exactly one ordered pair in $$G$$.
In other words, for every $$x$$ in $$X$$, there is exactly one element $$y$$ such that the ordered pair $$(x,y)$$ belongs to the set of pairs defining the function $$f$$. The set $$G$$ is called the **graph of the function**.

In this definition, $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are respectively called the domain and the codomain of the function $$f$$.
If $$(x, y)$$ belongs to the set defining $$f$$, then $$y$$ is the image of $$x$$ under $$f$$, or the value of $$f$$ applied to the argument $$x$$.
Especially in the context of numbers, one says also that $$y$$ is the value of $$f$$ for the value $$x$$ of its variable, or $$y$$ is the value of $$f$$ of $$x$$, denoted as $$y = f(x)$$.

The **range** of a function is the set of the images of all elements in the domain.

## Notation
Strictly speaking, it is an abuse of notation to write: "let $$f:\mathbb {R} \to \mathbb{R}$$ be the function $$f(x)=x^2$$" since $$f(x)$$ and $$x^2$$ should both be understood as the value of $$f$$ at $$x$$, rather than the function itself.
The correct, although pedantic, way is to write: "let $$f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$$ be the function defined by the equation $$f(x) = x^2$$, valid for all real values of $$x$$".
This distinction in language and notation becomes important in cases where functions themselves serve as inputs for other functions.

To explicitly express domain $$X$$ and the codomain $$Y$$ of a function $$f$$, the arrow notation is often used:

$$$f: X \to Y$$$

"_the function f from X to Y_"


This is often used in relation with the arrow notation for elements, often stacked immediately below the arrow notation giving the function symbol, domain, and codomain:

$$$x\mapsto f(x)$$$

"_f maps x to f (x)_"
