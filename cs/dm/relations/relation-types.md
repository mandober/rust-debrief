Some important types of binary relations $$R$$ between two sets $$X$$ and $$Y$$ (to emphasize that $$X$$ and $$Y$$ can be different sets, some authors call these heterogeneous relations):

Basic relations
- **Empty** relation between two sets is the empty set
- **Full** relation: the Cartesian product between two sets
- **Identity** relation on a set $$X^2$$ is $$R_{Id} = \{(x,x):x\in R\}$$
- **Inverse** relation, $$R'$$, of a relation $$R$$ is $$R'=\{(y,x):(x,y)\in R\}$$.

Types of relations
- Reflexive
- Irreflexive
- Coreflexive
- Symmetric
- Antisymmetric
- Asymmetric
- Transitive

Compound relations
* Equivalence







**Reflexive**: relation R on set A is called Reflexive if ∀a∈A is related to a (aRa holds)
Example: relation R={(a,a),(b,b)} on set X={a,b} is reflexive.

**Irreflexive** relation R on set A is called Irreflexive if no a∈A is related to a (aRa does not hold).
Example
The relation R={(a,b),(b,a)} on set X={a,b} is irreflexive.

**Symmetric** relation R on set A is called Symmetric if xRy implies yRx, ∀x∈A and ∀y∈A.
Example
The relation R={(1,2),(2,1),(3,2),(2,3)} on set A={1,2,3} is symmetric.

**Antisymmetric**
relation R on set A is called Anti-Symmetric if xRy and yRx implies x=y∀x∈A and ∀y∈A.
Example
The relation R={(x,y)→N|x≤y} is anti-symmetric since x≤y and y≤x implies x=y.

**Transitive**
relation R on set A is called Transitive if xRy and yRz implies xRz,∀x,y,z∈A.
Example:
The relation R={(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)} on set A={1,2,3} is transitive.


A relation is an **equivalence relation** if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
Example
The relation R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2),(1,3),(3,1)} on set A={1,2,3} is an equivalence relation since it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
