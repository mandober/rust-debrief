# Total order

A linear order, total order, simple order, or (non-strict) ordering is a binary relation on some set `X`, which is **antisymmetric**, **transitive**, and **total** (this relation is denoted here by infix `<=` (le = lower than or equal).

A set paired with a total order is called a totally ordered set, a linearly ordered set, a simply ordered set, or a chain.

A set `X` is totally ordered under `<=` if the following statements hold for all `a`, `b`, `c` in `X`:

- `∀ (a, b, c) ∈ X`


transitivity: `a <= b` ∧ `b <= c` ⟹ `a <= c`



Antisymmetry eliminates uncertain cases when both a precedes b and b precedes a.[1] A relation having the property of "totality" means that any pair of elements in the set of the relation are comparable under the relation. This also means that the set can be diagrammed as a line of elements, giving it the name linear.[2] Totality also implies reflexivity, i.e., a ≤ a. Therefore, a total order is also a (special case of a) partial order, as, for a partial order, the totality condition is replaced by the weaker condition of reflexivity. An extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a linear extension of that partial order.


- for all: `∀`
- implies: `⟹`
