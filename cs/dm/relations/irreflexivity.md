> A binary relation is **irreflexive**, or **anti-reflexive**, if no element is related to itself.

Irreflexive relation prohibits membership for identity pairs. In an endorelation, $$X^2$$, on a set $$X=\{1,2,3\}$$, the relation is irreflexive if it doesn't contain any of the identity pairs i.e. $$(1,1)$$, $$(2,2)$$ or $$(3,3)$$. If it contains even a single id pair, it is __non-irreflexive__. If it contains all the id pairs it is reflexive.

An example is the "_greater than_" relation on the set of real numbers, since no real number is greater than itself.

Not every relation which is not reflexive is irreflexive; it is possible to define relations where some elements are related to themselves but others are not.

For example, the binary relation "_the product of x and y is even_" is reflexive on the set of even natural numbers, irreflexive on the set of odd natural numbers, and neither reflexive nor irreflexive on the set of natural numbers.

Examples of irreflexive relations include:
- $$\not =$$, "_is not equal to_"
- $$\lt$$, "_is less than_"
- $$\gt$$, "_is greater than_"
- $$\subset$$, "_is a proper subset of_"
