## List of properties
Important properties that a binary relation may have include:
- reflexivity, irreflexivity, coreflexivity
- symmetry, antisymmetry, asymmetry
- transitivity
- totality
- right Euclidean, left Euclidean, Euclidean
- trichotomy, serial properties, set-like properties


## List of relations
List of some relations by properties
- **equivalence**: reflexive, symmetric, transitive.
- **partial equivalence**: symmetric, transitive.
- **reflexive**: symmetric, transitive, serial.
- **partial order**: reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive.
- **total order** (linear order, or chain): partial order that is total.
- **well-order**: linear order where every nonempty subset has a least element.



## total
This definition for total is different from left total. 
For example, `>=` is a total relation.

## trichotomous
For example, `>` is a trichotomous relation, while the relation "divides" on natural numbers is not.

## Euclidean
A Euclidean relation is both left and right Euclidean. Equality is a Euclidean relation because if `x=y` and `x=z`, then `y=z`.

## serial
"Is greater than" is a serial relation on the integers.
But it is not a serial relation on the positive integers, because there is no `y` in the positive integers such that `1 > y`. 
However, "is less than" is a serial relation on the positive integers, the rational numbers and the real numbers.

Every reflexive relation is serial: for a given `x`, choose `y = x`.
A serial relation can be equivalently characterized as every element having a non-empty successor neighborhood. Similarly an inverse serial relation is a relation in which every element has non-empty predecessor neighborhood.

## set-like (or local)
The usual ordering `<` on the class of ordinal numbers is set-like, while its inverse `>` is not.





## Partial equivalence relation
A partial equivalence relation (PER) `R` on a set `X` is a relation that is _symmetric_ and _transitive_.

It holds for all `a, b, c âˆˆ X` that:
1. if `aRb`, then `bRa` (symmetry)
2. if `aRb` and `bRc`, then `aRc` (transitivity)

If `R` is also reflexive, then `R` is an equivalence relation.



## Partially ordered set
A partially ordered set (poset) consists of a set together with a binary relation indicating that, for certain pairs of elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other in the ordering. The word "partial" is used as an indication that not every pair of elements need be comparable: there may be pairs of elements for which neither element precedes the other.

Partial orders thus generalize total orders, in which every pair is comparable.
