A binary relation $$R$$ over a set $$X$$ is symmetric if it holds for all $$a$$ and $$b$$ in $$X$$ that $$a$$ is related to $$b$$ if and only if $$b$$ is related to $$a$$.

Formal definition: $$∀a,b ∈ X (aRb ⇔ bRa)$$











## symmetric
"Is a blood relative of" is a symmetric relation, because x is a blood relative of y if and only if y is a blood relative of x.

## antisymmetric
For example, $$>=$$ is anti-symmetric; so is $$>$$, but vacuously (the condition in the definition is always false).

## asymmetric
A relation is asymmetric if and only if it is both anti-symmetric and irreflexive. For example, $$>$$ is asymmetric, but $$>=$$ is not.
