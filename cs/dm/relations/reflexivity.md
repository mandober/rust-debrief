### Reflexivity

A binary relation is **reflexive** if every element of the set is related to itself.

If we have a set related to itself, $$A={1,2,3,4}$$, for relation $$R$$ to be reflefive, $$xRx$$, __it must contain all the identity pairs__, i.e. $$R=\{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)\}$$. Missing a single pair will make this relation __non-reflexive__.

To see that the the "equals", `=`, operator is reflexive with respect to, e.g., the domain of natural numbers, we have to show that $$x=x$$, which is always true.




Along with symmetry and transitivity, reflexivity is one of the 3 properties defining __equivalence relations__.

An example is the relation "_is equal to_" (equality) on the set of real numbers, since every real number is equal to itself.

Other examples include:
- "_is greater than or equal to_"
- "_is less than or equal to_"
- "_is a subset of_" (set inclusion)
- "_divides_" (divisibility)
