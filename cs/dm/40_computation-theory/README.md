The goal of the Theory of Computation is to develop formal mathematical models of computation that reflect real-world computers.

Theory of Computation can be divided into the following three areas:
- Complexity Theory
- Computability Theory
- Automata Theory


## Complexity Theory
The main question of Complexity Theory:
"What makes some problems computationally hard and other problems easy?"

Central Question in Complexity Theory:
Classify problems according to their degree of "difficulty".
Give a rigorous proof that problems that seem to be "hard" are really "hard".

## Computability Theory
In the 1930â€™s, Godel, Turing, and Church discovered that some of the fundamental mathematical problems cannot be solved by a "computer" (even though computers were invented only in the 1940's). An example of such a problem is "Is an arbitrary mathematical statement true or false?"

To tackle such a problem, we need formal definitions of the notions of
- computer
- algorithm
- computation

The theoretical models that were proposed in order to understand solvable
and unsolvable problems led to the development of real computers.

Central Question in Computability Theory:
Classify problems as being **solvable** or **unsolvable**.

## Automata theory
Automata Theory deals with definitions and properties of different types of
"computation models". Examples of such models are:
- **Finite Automata**: used in text processing, compilers, hardware design.
- **Context-Free Grammars**: used to define programming languages. Also in AI.
- **Turing Machines**: form a simple abstract model of a computer

Central Question in Automata Theory:
"Do these models have the same power, or can one model solve more problems than the other?"
