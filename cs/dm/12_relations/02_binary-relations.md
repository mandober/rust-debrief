A binary relation on a set is a collection of ordered pairs of the set's elements.

A binary relation on a set $$X$$ is a set of ordered pairs of elements of $$X$$; it is a subset of the Cartesian product $$X^2 = X \times X$$.

> A binary relation between sets $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is a subset of $$X \times Y$$.

The terms _correspondence_, _dyadic relation_ and _2-place relation_ are synonyms for binary relation.

Binary relations are used to model concepts like "is greater than", "is equal to", and similar. The concept of function is defined as a special kind of binary relation.

A binary relation is the special case n = 2 of an n-ary relation R ⊆ A1 × … × An, that is, a set of n-tuples where the jth component of each n-tuple is taken from the jth domain Aj of the relation. An example for a ternary relation on Z×Z×Z is " ... lies between ... and ...", containing e.g. the triples (5,2,8), (5,8,2), and (−4,9,−7).



The Cartesian product, $$X \times Y$$, from set $$X$$ to set $$Y$$ represents the **full relation** between two sets, where every ordered pair participates in the relation.

Any subset of $$X \times Y$$ is called a relation between $$X$$ and $$Y$$.

On the other side of the extreme is the __empty relation__, which is an empty set since no elements, let alone ordered pairs, participate. Despite being empty, it is still considered as a relation between two sets.


In between these two extremes are all other relations, therefore, any relation $$R$$ from set $$X$$ to $$Y$$ is a subset of the Cartesian product, $$X \times Y$$.

Relations may also exist between objects of the same set or between objects of two or more sets.

Any subset of $$X \times X$$ is called a relation on $$X$$.

Most of these relations are anonymous, some popular ones have a name, and the most popular come with a name and a special symbol attached.



Since a relation $$R$$ on $$X$$ is a subset of $$X \times X$$, it is an element of the powerset of $$X \times X$$ i.e. $$R\subseteq \mathcal{P}(X \times X)$$

If $$R$$ is a relation on $$X$$ and $$(x,y)\in R$$ then we also write $$xRy$$ and read it as "_x is in R-relation to y_", or simply, "_x is in relation to y_", if R is understood.

A binary relation $$R$$ on the sets $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is an element in their power set: $$R \in \mathfrak{P}(X \times Y)$$


If $$X = Y$$ then we simply say that the binary relation is over $$X$$, or that it is an **endorelation** over $$X$$.

$$Rxy$$ or $$xRy$$ denotes a **homogeneous** relation when $$X = Y$$ and a **heterogeneous** relation when $$X \not = Y$$.
