# Logic glossary


## Abstract machine
An abstract machine is a theoretical model of a computer hardware or software system used in automata theory.

## Affine type system
Affine type systems allow exchange and weakening, but not contraction: every (occurrence of a) variable is used at most once. Affine types are a version of linear types allowing a resource to be unused. An affine resource can only be used once, while a linear resource must be used once.

## Analytic–synthetic distinction
The analytic–synthetic distinction (also called the analytic–synthetic dichotomy) is a semantic distinction, used primarily in philosophy to distinguish propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) into two types: analytic propositions and synthetic propositions. Analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.

## Argumentation theory
Argumentation theory, or argumentation, is the interdisciplinary study of how conclusions can be reached through logical reasoning; that is, claims based, soundly or not, on premises. It includes the arts and sciences of civil debate, dialogue, conversation, and persuasion.

## Axiology
Axiologyis the philosophical study of value. It is either the collective term for ethics and aesthetics, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to value theory and meta-ethics.

## Axiom
An axiom (postulate) is a statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments. In classic logic, an axiom is an evident and well-established statement that needs no further proof. In modern logic, an axiom is a premise for reasoning. In brief, an axiom is a generally accepted statement.

## Church–Turing thesis
In computability theory, the Church–Turing thesis is a hypothesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers is computable by a man following an algorithm, ignoring resource limitations, if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine.

## Conjecture
An unproved statement that is believed true is called a conjecture. To be considered a conjecture, a statement must usually be proposed publicly, at which point the name of the proponent may be attached to the conjecture, as with Goldbach's conjecture. Other famous conjectures include the Collatz conjecture and the Riemann hypothesis. On the other hand, Fermat's Last Theorem has always been known by that name, even before it was proved; it was never known as "Fermat's conjecture".

## Entscheidungsproblem
(german, "decision problem", [ɛntʃaɪ̯dʊŋspʁoblem]) is a challenge posed by David Hilbert in 1928, that asks an ant, named Chai Dung, what is his problem. More preciselly, he asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first-order logic and determines whether the statement is universally valid (valid in every structure satisfying the axioms). By the completeness theorem of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the decision problem can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic. In 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papers showing that a general solution to the decision problem is impossible.

## Fallacy
In reasoning to argue a claim, a fallacy is reasoning that is evaluated as logically incorrect and that undermines the logical validity of the argument and permits its recognition as unsound.

## First-order logic
While propositional logic deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers predicates and quantification. Predicate logic uses quantified variables over objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so rather than propositions such as "Socrates is a man" one can have expressions in the form "there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man" and "there exists" is a quantifier while "X" is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations. In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets.

## Formal logic
Formal logic is the study of inference with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule i.e. a rule that is not about any particular thing or property.

## Fuzzy logic
Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic in which the truth values of variables may be any real number between 0 and 1. It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. By contrast, in Boolean logic, the truth values of variables may only be the integer values 0 or 1.

## Linear type system
Linear type systems allow exchange, but neither weakening nor contraction: every variable is used exactly once. Linear types ensures that objects are used exactly once, allowing the system to safely deallocate an object after its use. Linear types can be used to model heap-based memory allocation.

## Logical form
A logical form of a syntactic expression is a precisely-specified semantic version of that expression in a formal system. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly ambiguous statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system.

## Logical consequence
Logical consequence (also **entailment**) is a fundamental concept in logic, which describes the relationship between statements that hold true when one statement logically follows from one or more statements. A valid logical argument is one in which the conclusion is entailed by the premises, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises.

## Logical truth
Logical truth is one of the most fundamental concepts in logic, and there are different theories on its nature. A logical truth is a statement which is true, and remains true under all reinterpretations of its components other than its logical constants.

## Informal logic
Informal logic is the study of natural language arguments. The study of fallacies is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.

### Mathematical logic
Mathematical logic is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of model theory, proof theory, set theory, and computability (recursion) theory.

## Mathematical object
An abstract object that can be formally defined, and which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs with.

## Metalogic
Metalogic is the study of the metatheory of logic. Whereas logic studies how logical systems can be used to construct valid and sound arguments, metalogic studies the properties of logical systems.

## Metamathematics
Metamathematics is the study of mathematics itself using mathematical methods. This study produces metatheories, which are mathematical theories about other mathematical theories.

## Necessity and sufficiency
In logic, necessity and sufficiency are terms used to describe an implicational relationship between statements. The assertion that one statement is a necessary and sufficient condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true.

## Non-classical logic
Non-classical logics (and sometimes alternative logics) are formal systems that differ in a significant way from standard logical systems such as propositional and predicate logic. There are several ways in which this is done, including by way of extensions, deviations, and variations.

## Ordered type system
Ordered type systems discard exchange, contraction, and weakening: every variable is used exactly once in the order it was introduced. Ordered types can be used to model stack-based memory allocation (contrast with linear types which can be used to model heap-based memory allocation). Without the exchange property, an object may only be used when at the top of the modelled stack, after which it is popped off resulting in every variable being used exactly once in the order it was introduced.

## Philosophical logic
Philosophical logic refers to those areas of philosophy in which recognized methods of logic have traditionally been used to solve or advance the discussion of philosophical problems. Among these, Sybil Wolfram highlights the study of argument, meaning, and truth, while Colin McGinn presents identity, existence, predication, necessity and truth as the main topics of his book on the subject.Philosophical logic also addresses extensions and alternatives to traditional, "classical" logic known as "non-classical" logics.

## Philosophy of logic
Following the developments in formal logic with symbolic logic in the late nineteenth century and mathematical logic in the twentieth, topics traditionally treated by logic not being part of formal logic have tended to be termed either philosophy of logic or philosophical logic if no longer simply logic. Compared to the history of logic the demarcation between philosophy of logic and philosophical logic is of recent coinage and not always entirely clear.

## Predicate
A predicate takes an entity or entities in the domain of discourse as input while outputs are either True or False. Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables. For example, predicates can be used in set builder notation to indicate set membership: a predicate P(x) will be true or false, depending on whether x belongs to a set.

## Premise
A premise is a statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion. A premise is an assumption that something is true.

# Propositions
Propositions are declarative sentences that have a truth value.

## Propositional logic
Propositional (sentential) logic is based on propositions and argument flow. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives. The propositions without logical connectives are called atomic propositions. Unlike first-order logic, propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic.

## Logical connectives
Logical connectives (logical operators) are symbols or words used to connect sentences in a grammatically valid way, such that the value of the compound sentence produced depends only on that of the original sentences and on the meaning of the connective. Common logical connectives are negation, conjunction, disjunction, biconditional, implication.

## Relevant type system
Relevant type systems allow exchange and contraction, but not weakening: every variable is used at least once.

## Second-order logic
Ssecond-order logic is an extension of first-order logic, which itself is an extension of propositional logic. Second-order logic is in turn extended by higher-order logic and type theory. First-order logic quantifies only variables that range over individuals (elements of the domain of discourse), second-order logic additionally quantifies over relations.

## Statement
In logic, the term statement is variously understood to mean either: (a) a meaningful declarative sentence that is true or false, or (b) the assertion that is made by a true or false declarative sentence.In the latter case, a statement is distinct from a sentence in that a sentence is only one formulation of a statement, whereas there may be many other formulations expressing the same statement.

## Strict conditional
In logic, a strict conditional (strict implication) is a conditional governed by a modal operator, that is, a logical connective of modal logic. It is logically equivalent to the material conditional of classical logic, combined with the necessity operator from modal logic.

## Substitution
Substitution is a fundamental concept in logic. A substitution is a syntactic transformation on formal expressions.

## Substructural type system
Substructural type systems are a family of type systems analogous to substructural logics where one or more of the structural rules are absent or only allowed under controlled circumstances. Such systems are useful for constraining access to system resources such as files, locks and memory by keeping track of changes of state that occur and preventing invalid states. Substructural type systems: linear, affine, relevant, ordered.

## Syllogisms
A syllogism is a kind of logical argument where a quantified statement of a specific form (the conclusion) is inferred from two other quantified statements (the premises). It is a logical argument where one starts with premises and reaches a conclusion.

A syllogism is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true. In its earliest form, defined by Aristotle, from the combination of a general statement (the major premise) and a specific statement (the minor premise), a conclusion is deduced.

## Symbolic logic
Symbolic logic is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference. It is often divided into two main branches, propositional and predicate logic.

## Syntax
In logic, syntax is anything having to do with formal languages or formal systems without regard to any interpretation or meaning given to them. Syntax is concerned with the rules used for constructing, or transforming the symbols and words of a language, as contrasted with the semantics of a language which is concerned with its meaning.

## Theorem
A theorem is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements (other theorems) and generally accepted statements (axioms). It is a logical consequence of the axioms.

## Truth value
Truth or logical value is a value indicating the relation of a proposition to truth. A proposition has a truth value if it can be evaluated to true or false.

## Turing machine
A Turing machine (TM) is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Given any algorithm, a TM capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed. The Turing machine was "invented" in 1936 by Alan Turing.

## Turing completeness
Turing completeness is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers. Almmost all programming languages are Turing complete.

## Universal Turing machine (UTM)
A Turing machine that is able to simulate any other TM is called a universal Turing machine.

## Validity
In logic, an argument is valid if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false. It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true, but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion.
