# Discrete Mathematics

Mathematics can be broadly classified into two categories:
- Continuous mathematics
- Discrete mathematics

__Continuous Mathematics__
is based on continuous number line of real numbers. It is characterized by the fact that between any two numbers, there is an infinite set of numbers. For example, in continuous mathematics a function can be plotted as a smooth curve.

__Discrete Mathematics__ (DM)
is based on descrete number line of integers. It is characterized by the fact that between any two integers, there is a finite set of integers. For example, a function from one finite set to another can be defined as list of ordered pairs made out of elements of the two sets. 

Discrete math studies the mathematical objects that are descrete, separate, and often enumerable. Since computers operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits, DM studies the concepts and problems in CS, including algorithms and their complexity, formal and programming languages and their correctness, automated theorem proving.
