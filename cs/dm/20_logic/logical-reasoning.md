# Logical reasoning 

There are 3 kinds of logical reasoning:
1. Abduction
1. Deduction
1. Induction


__Abductive reasoning__ (also called abduction, abductive inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation.

__Deductive reasoning__, also deductive logic, logical deduction is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion.Deductive reasoning goes in the same direction as that of the conditionals, and links premises with conclusions. If all premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are followed, then the conclusion reached is necessarily true.

__Inductive reasoning__ (as opposed to deductive reasoning or abductive reasoning) is a method of reasoning in which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of the conclusion. While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may be probable, based upon the evidence given.Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning as the derivation of general principles from specific observations, though some sources disagree with this usage.The philosophical definition of inductive reasoning is more nuanced than simple progression from particular/individual instances to broader generalizations.



Given
- a precondition or premise
- a conclusion or logical consequence
- a rule or material conditional that implies the conclusion given the precondition, one can explain that

__Deductive__ reasoning determines 
  whether the truth of a conclusion 
  can be determined for that rule, 
  based solely on the truth of the premises. 
  Example: 
  "When it rains, things outside get wet. 
  The grass is outside, 
  therefore: when it rains, the grass gets wet."
  Mathematical logic and philosophical logic are commonly associated with this type of reasoning.

__Inductive__ reasoning attempts to support a determination of the rule.
  It hypothesizes a rule 
  after numerous examples are taken
  to be a conclusion that follows 
  from a precondition 
  in terms of such a rule. 
  Example: 
  "The grass got wet numerous times when it rained,
  therefore: the grass always gets wet when it rains." 
  While they may be persuasive, 
  these arguments are not deductively valid (see the problem of induction).
  Science is associated with this type of reasoning.

__Abductive__ reasoning, a.k.a. inference 
  to the best explanation, 
  selects a cogent set of preconditions.
  Given a true conclusion and a rule, 
  it attempts to select some possible premises 
  that, if true also, can support the conclusion, 
  though not uniquely. 
  Example:
  "When it rains, the grass gets wet. 
  The grass is wet. 
  Therefore, it might have rained." 
  This kind of reasoning can be used to develop a hypothesis, 
  which in turn can be tested by additional reasoning or data. 
  Diagnosticians, detectives, and scientists often use this type of reasoning.
