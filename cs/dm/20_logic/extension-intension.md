# Extension and Intension


# Extension (logic)
In any of several studies that treat the use of signs (e.g. linguistics, logic, mathematics, semantics, semiotics) the **extension** of a sign (concept, idea) consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its **intension** (comprehension) which consists, very roughly, of the ideas, properties, or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

## Extensionality
In logic, __extensionality__, or _extensional equality_, refers to principles that judge objects to be equal if they have the same external properties. It stands in contrast to the concept of __intensionality__, which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same.

For example, consider the two functions f and g mapping from and to natural numbers, defined as follows:
- To find f(n), first add 5 to n, then double it: λn.2(n+5)
- To find g(n), first double n, then add 10:      λn.2n+10

These functions are _extensionally equal_ ("from outside"), but the definitions of the functions are not equal, and in that intensional ("internal") sense the functions are not the same.

There are many predicates (relations) that are intensionally different but extensionally identical.


## Comprehension (logic)
In logic, the __comprehension__ of an object is the totality of intensions, that is, attributes, characters, marks, properties, or qualities, that the object possesses, or else the totality of intensions that are pertinent to the context of a given discussion. This is the correct technical term for the whole collection of intensions of an object, but it is common in less technical usage to see 'intension' used for both the composite and the primitive ideas.
