# Extension and Intension

In any of several studies that treat the use of signs (e.g. linguistics, logic, mathematics, semantics, semiotics) the **extension** of a sign (concept, idea) consists of the things to which it applies, in contrast with its **intension** (comprehension) which consists, very roughly, of the ideas, properties, or corresponding signs that are implied or suggested by the concept in question.

## Extensionality
In logic, __extensionality__, or _extensional equality_, refers to principles that judge objects to be equal if they have the same external properties. It stands in contrast to the concept of __intensionality__, which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same.

For example, consider the two functions f and g mapping from and to natural numbers, defined as follows:
- To find f(n), first add 5 to n, then double it: λn.(n+5)*2
- To find g(n), first double n, then add 10:      λn.2n+10

These functions are extensionally equal; given the same input, both functions always produce the same value. But the definitions of the functions are not equal, and in that intensional sense the functions are not the same.

Similarly, in natural language there are many predicates (relations) that are intensionally different but are extensionally identical. For example, suppose that a town has one person named Joe, who is also the oldest person in the town. Then, the two argument predicates "has one person named", "is the oldest person in" are intensionally distinct, but extensionally equal for "Joe" in that "town" now.
