# Introduction to Logic


Logic is concerned with the most general laws of truth, and is now generally held to consist of the __systematic study of the form of valid inference__ i.e. existance of a logical relation between the assumptions of the inference and its conclusion.

> Logic is the study of inference.

The aim of logic in CS is to develop formal languages that can model concepts in programming languages so we can reason about them by constructing valid arguments that can be rigorously defended and proved by e.g. automated theorem proving software.

Logic has traditionally included classification of arguments, systematic exposition of the logical form, study of inference, study of semantics.

> Formal logic is the study of inference with purely formal content.

**Formal logic** is the study of inference with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule i.e. a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. In many definitions of logic, logical inference and inference with purely formal content are the same.

> A formal system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction.

**Symbolic logic** is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference. It is often divided into two main branches: propositional and predicate logic.

**Mathematical logic** is a subfield of mathematics exploring the applications of formal logic to mathematics. The unifying themes in mathematical logic include the study of the expressive power of formal systems and the deductive power of formal proof systems. Math logic is often divided into the fields of set theory, model theory, computability theory, proof theory, constructive mathematics. These areas share basic results on logic, particularly first-order logic, and definability.

The concept of logical form is central to logic. A **logical form** of a syntactic expression is a precisely specified semantic version of that expression in a formal system. Informally, the logical form attempts to formalize a possibly ambiguous statement into a statement with a precise, unambiguous logical interpretation with respect to a formal system.
