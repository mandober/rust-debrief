# Logical system

A formal logical system is an organization of terms used for the analysis of deduction, consisting of:
- an alphabet
- a language over the alphabet to construct sentences
- a rule for deriving sentences

Important properties of logical systems:
1. Consistency
1. Validity
1. Completeness
1. Soundness


__Consistency__ means that no theorem of the system contradicts another.

__Validity__ means that the system's rules of proof never allow a false inference from true premises.

Validity of argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. An argument is valid iff it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false.

This means it's not required for an argument to have actually true premises, but to have premises that if true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion.

__Completeness__ means that if a formula is true, it can be proven, that is, it is a theorem of the system.

__Soundness__ means that if any formula is a theorem of the system, it is true. This is the converse of completeness. In a distinct philosophical use of the term, an argument is sound when it is both valid and its premises are true.


Some logical systems do not have all 4 properties. As an example, Kurt GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems show that sufficiently complex formal systems of arithmetic cannot be consistent and complete. However, first-order predicate logics, not extended by specific axioms to be arithmetic formal systems with equality, can be complete and consistent.
