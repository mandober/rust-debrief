# URI Scheme

https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml

- `Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)`
- string that unambiguously identifies a particular resource.
- guarantee uniformity by following a set of predefined syntax rules.
- extensibility through, separately defined, hierarchical naming scheme.
- Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define URIs.
- `Uniform Resource Locator (URL)`: common form of URI.
- `Uniform Resource Name (URN)`: designed to complement URL.
- URN is an URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace.
- URN allows talking about a resource without knowing its location.
- URL specifies how to get or act on a representation of a resource, 
  specifying its primary access mechanism and network location.
- URN identifies an item, URL provides a method to find it.
- URI scheme finalized in RFC 3986 (Jan 2005)
