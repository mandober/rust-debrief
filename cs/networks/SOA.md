Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies.

A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:
* It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.
* It is self-contained.
* It is a black box for its consumers.
* It may consist of other underlying services.
* It was first termed a Service-Based Architecture, in 1998 by a team developing integrated foundational management services and then business process-type services based upon units of work and using CORBA as inter-process communications.

Different services can be used in conjunction to provide the functionality of a large software application, a principle it shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately-maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that make it easier for components to communicate and cooperate over a network, especially an IP network.

Web-oriented architecture (WOA) was coined in 2006 by Nick Gall of the Gartnerâ€™s group. It is a software architecture style that extends service-oriented architecture (SOA) to web-based applications. WOA was originally created by many web applications and sites, such as social websites and personal websites.
