# Path to type theory

- halting problem, to understand it, it's instructive to read up on
- The Lambda Calculus, and methods of evaluation
- The Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, needs a familiarity with
- Sequent Calculus
- Linear types and it's dual
- Linear Logic, and most recently there is
- Separation Logic
