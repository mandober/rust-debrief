# Assignment

An assignment statement sets the _value_ stored at the _memory address_ denoted by a _variable name_ (an assignment copies a value into the variable).

Most commonly used notation is `x = expr`, followed by `x := expr`. In some languages the "equals" symbol is regarded as an _operator_ (so the assignment _expression_ has a value), while others define the assignment as a _statement_ (it cannot be used in an expression context).

_Re-assignment_ typically allows a variable to hold different values at different times during its _lifetime_ and _scope_. However, some languages disallow such mutation for the sake of _referential transparency_; an expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.
