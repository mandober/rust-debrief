# Bytecode

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bytecode

Bytecode (also portable code or p-code) is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter.
- Bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, references (addresses).
- Bytecodes encode the result of compiler's parsing and semantic analysis.

The name bytecode stems from instruction sets that have one-byte opcodes followed by optional parameters. Intermediate representations such as bytecode may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run cross-platform, on different devices. Bytecode may often be either directly executed on a virtual machine (a p-code machine i.e., interpreter), or it may be further compiled into machine code for better performance.
