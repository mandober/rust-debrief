The IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) is a technical standard for floating-point computation established in 1985 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The standard addressed many problems found in the diverse floating point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and portably. Many hardware floating point units (FPU) now use the IEEE 754 standard.

The standard defines:
- arithmetic formats: sets of binary and decimal floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including signed zeros and subnormal numbers), 
- infinities, and special "not a number" values (NaNs)
- interchange formats: encodings (bit strings) that may be used to exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form
- rounding rules: properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions
- operations: arithmetic and other operations (such as trigonometric functions) on arithmetic formats
- exception handling: indications of exceptional conditions (such as division by zero, overflow, etc.)
