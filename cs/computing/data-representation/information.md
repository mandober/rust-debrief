In 1948, Claude Shannon proposed a model for communications over the telephone, a model expanded by Warren Weaver in 1949, showing that Shannon's model applies to any communication system.

The Shannon/Weaver model shows that the data transmission systems should consist of 6 components:
1. **Sender** (or source) that transmits the message.
1. **Encoder** to encode the message.
1. **Message** itself.
1. **Channel** (or medium) through which the message is transmitted.
1. **Decoder** to decode the message.
1. **Receiver** (or destination) as the intended receiver of the message.


**Unit of information** is the capacity of a data storage system (or communication channel), used to measure the capacities of other systems.

**Bit**, the funamental unit of information, is the capacity of a system that has only 2 states. **Binary digits** are concrete symbols (i.e. 1 and 0) that can be placed in a bit. The name "bit" is portmanteau of "binary digit", but they are not the same: a bit is the maximum amount of information that can be conveyed by a binary digit.

One bit is typically defined as the information entropy of a random binary variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such variable is consumed (i.e. when the value becomes known).
