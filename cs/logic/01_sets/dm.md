Mathematics can be broadly classified into two categories:
1. Continuous Mathematics
2. Discrete Mathematics

__Continuous Mathematics__
is based upon continuous number line or the real numbers. It is characterized by the fact that between any two numbers, there is an infinite set of numbers. For example, a function in continuous mathematics can be plotted in a smooth curve without breaks.

__Discrete Mathematics__
involves itself with distinct values; i.e. between any two points, there is a countable number of points. For example, if we have a finite set of objects, a function can be defined as a list of ordered pairs having these objects, and it can be presented as a complete list of ordered pairs.
