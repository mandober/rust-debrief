If all elements of the set $$A$$ are also elements of the set $$B$$, then $$A$$ is the __subset__ of $$B$$, denoted by $$A \subseteq B$$.

In fact, this also describes the situation when a set $$B$$ does not have any additional elements then set the $$A$$ i.e. when they are the same set: $$\{a,b,c\} \subseteq \{a,b,c\}$$.


even if two sets are the same, the subset relation can be denoted as $$\{a,b,c\} \subseteq \{a,b,c\}$$.


If all elements of a set $$A$$ are also elements of a set $$B$$, then $$A$$ is a __subset__ of $$B$$, denoted by $$A \subseteq B$$. 



$$\text{If } A=\{a,b\} \text{ and set } B=\{a,b,c\} \text{ then } A\subseteq B$$


At the same time $$B$$ is a __superset__ of $$A$$: $$A \supseteq B$$.


__Every set is a subset of itself__.    
e.g. $$\{a,b,c\} \supseteq \{a,b,c\}$$

__The empty set is subset of every set__.    
e.g $$\{\} \supseteq \{a,b,c\}$$ or $$\varnothing \supseteq \{a,b,c\}$$

The set of even numbers is a subset of the set of natural numbers.


But fa, b, eg is not a subset of fa, b, cg


Subset and powerset:
- If all elements of a set $$A$$ are also elements of a set $$B$$, then $$A$$ is a __subset__ of $$B$$: $$A \subseteq B$$,
- and $$B$$ is a __superset__ of $$A$$: $$B \supseteq A$$
- a set $$B$$ is __equal__ to $$A$$ if the two sets consist of exactly the same elements: $$A = B \iff A \subseteq B \land B \subseteq A$$.
- if $$A \subseteq B$$ but $$B \neq A$$ then $$A$$ is a __proper subset__ of $$B$$: $$A \subset B$$.
- if a set $$P$$ contains all possible subsets of a set $$A$$, then $$P$$ is a __powerset__ of $$A$$, denoted as $$P(A)$$.
- e.g. if $$A=\{a,b\}$$, then $$P=\{\{a\},\{b\},\{ab\},\{\varnothing\}\}$$
- here, the cardinality (number of elements) of $$P$$ is 4, denoted as $$|P|=4$$
