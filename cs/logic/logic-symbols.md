- The __falsum__ symbol, $$\bot$$
  - _false, bottom, falsity_
  - contradiction, unconditional falsity
  - expressed by $$Opq$$
- The __verum__ , $$\top$$
  - _true, top, tee_
  - tautology, unconditional truth
  - expressed by $$Vpq$$
- The __hook__ symbol, $$\lnot$$
  - _negation_, _NOT_
  - logical negation
  - unary operator
- The __wedge__ symbol, $$\land$$
  - _ascending wedge, AND, ac, atque_
  - conjunct $$\land$$ conjunct
  - logical conjunction
- The __vel__ symbol, $$\lor$$
  - _descending wedge, OR, vee_
  - disjunct $$\lor$$ disjunct
  - logical disjunction
- The __material implication__ symbol, $$\to$$
  - antecedent $$\to$$ consequent
  - read "_implies_", "_if...then_",
- The __turnstile__ symbol, $$\vdash$$
  - "_yields_", "_proves_", "_satisfies_" or "_entails_".
  - denotes syntactic consequence
- The __double turnstile__, $$\models$$
  - "_entails_", "_models_", "_makes true_", "_is stronger than_", "_is a semantic consequence of_"
  - semantic consequence, closely related to the turnstile, which denotes syntactic consequence.


Formulae of Sentential Logic (definition)  
1. Every atomic formula φ is a formula of sentential logic.
2. If φ is a formula of sentential logic, then so is ¬φ.
3. If φ and ψ are formulae of sentential logic, then so are each of the following: (φ & ψ), (φ ∨ ψ), (φ → ψ)
4. An expression φ of sentential logic is a formula only if it can be constructed by one or more applications of the first three rules.

This is an inductive definition, giving rules for generating or constructing the objects falling under the definition.
