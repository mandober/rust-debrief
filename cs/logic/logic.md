# Logic

https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Logic

The aim of logic in CS is to develop languages to model the encountered situations in CS in such a way that we can reason about them formally. Reasoning about situations means constructing arguments about them in a formal way, so the arguments are valid and can be defended rigorously, or executed on a machine.

Logic is a subject concerned with the most general laws of truth, and is now generally held to consist of the systematic study of the form of valid inference. A valid inference is one where there is a specific relation of logical support between the assumptions of the inference and its conclusion.

There is no universal agreement as to the exact scope and subject matter of logic, but it has traditionally included
- classification of arguments 
- systematic exposition of the "logical form" common to all valid arguments
- the study of inference, including fallacies
- the study of semantics, including paradoxes

Historically, logic has been studied in philosophy (since ancient times) and mathematics (since the mid XIX century), and recently logic has been studied in CS and other fields.


## Concept

- Informal logic
- Formal logic
- Symbolic logic
- Mathematical logic

The concept of logical form is central to logic. The validity of an argument is determined by its logical form, not by its content. Traditional Aristotelian syllogistic logic and modern symbolic logic are examples of formal logic.

### Informal logic
Informal logic is the study of natural language arguments. The study of fallacies is an important branch of informal logic. Since much informal argument is not strictly speaking deductive, on some conceptions of logic, informal logic is not logic at all.

### Formal logic
Formal logic is the study of inference with purely formal content. An inference possesses a purely formal content if it can be expressed as a particular application of a wholly abstract rule i.e. a rule that is not about any particular thing or property. In many definitions of logic, logical inference and inference with purely formal content are the same. 

### Symbolic logic
Symbolic logic is the study of symbolic abstractions that capture the formal features of logical inference. It is often divided into two main branches: propositional and predicate logic.

### Mathematical logic
Mathematical logic is an extension of symbolic logic into other areas, in particular to the study of model theory, proof theory, set theory, and recursion theory.
