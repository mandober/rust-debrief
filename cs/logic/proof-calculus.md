# Proof calculus

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_calculus?oldformat=true

A **proof calculus** or a **proof system** is built to prove statements. 

A proof system includes the components:
* Language:
  The set of formulas admitted by the system,
  for example, [propositional logic][21] or [first-order logic][22].
* [Rules of inference][23]:
  List of rules that can be employed to prove theorems from axioms and theorems.
* [Axioms][24]:
  Formulas in L assumed to be valid. All theorems are derived from axioms.

Usually a given proof calculus encompasses more than a single particular formal system, since many proof calculi are under-determined and can be used for radically different logics. For example, a paradigmatic case is the [sequent calculus][25], which can be used to express the [consequence relations][26] of both [intuitionistic logic][27] and [relevance logic][28]. Thus, loosely speaking, a proof calculus is a template or [design pattern][29], characterized by a certain style of formal inference, that may be specialized to produce specific formal systems, namely by specifying the actual inference rules for such a system. There is no consensus among logicians on how best to define the term. 


## Examples of proof calculi

widely used:
- Hilbert-Ackermann system of FOL, one of Hilbert systems
- calculus of natural deduction (Gerhard Gentzen)
- sequent calculus (Gerhard Gentzen)

rarely used:
- Aristotle's syllogistic calculus
- Gottlob Frege's two-dimensional notation of the Begriffsschrift
- C.S. Peirce's existential graph



The most widely known proof calculi are those classical calculi that are still in widespread use:
* The class of [Hilbert systems][31],
  of which the most famous example is the 1928 [Hilbert-Ackermann system][32] of [first-order logic][22];
* [Gerhard Gentzen][33]'s calculus of [natural deduction][34],
  which is the first formalism of [structural proof theory][35], 
  and which is the cornerstone of the [formulae-as-types correspondence][36] relating logic to [functional programming][37];
* Gentzen's [sequent calculus][25], 
  which is the most studied formalism of structural proof theory.


Many other proof calculi were, or might have been, seminal, but are not widely used today.
* [Aristotle][38]'s [syllogistic][39] calculus, 
  presented in the [_Organon][40]_, readily admits formalisation. There is still some modern interest in syllogistic, carried out under the [aegis][41] of [term logic][42].
* [Gottlob Frege][43]'s two-dimensional 
  notation of the [_Begriffsschrift][44]_ (1879) 
  is usually regarded as introducing the modern concept 
  of [quantifier][45] to logic.
* [C.S. Peirce][46]'s [existential graph][47] 
  might easily have been seminal, had history worked out differently.


Modern research in logic teems with rival proof calculi: 

* Several systems have been proposed which replace the usual textual syntax with some graphical syntax. [Proof nets][48] and [cirquent calculus][49] are among such systems.
* Recently, many logicians interested in [structural proof theory][50] have proposed calculi with [deep inference][51], for instance [display logic][52], [hypersequents][53], the [calculus of structures][54], and [bunched implication][55].
