# Programming Language Theory

Programming language theory (PLT) is the study of programming languages and their features.

Programming Language Theory:
- PL Design
- PL Implementation
- PL Analysis
- PL Characterization
- PL Classification

**Programming language** is a formally constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

**Formal semantics** is the formal specification of the behaviour of computer programs and programming languages. 
  Formal semantics:
  - Denotational Semantics
  - Operational Semantics
  - Axiomatic Semantics

**Type theory** studies type systems, which are a tractable *syntactic methods* for proving certain program behavior (by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute).

**Program analysis** is the general problem of examining a program and determining key characteristics.

**Program transformation** is the process of transforming a program in one to another form.

**Comparative PL analysis** classifies PL into different types based on their characteristics. Broad categories of PLs are often known as *programming paradigms*.

**Metaprogramming** is the generation of higher-order programs which, when executed, produce other programs.

**Domain-specific languages** (DSL) are languages constructed to efficiently solve problems of a particular part of domain.

**Compiler theory** studies compiler design. 
  Compiler phases:
  - syntax analysis
  - semantic analysis
  - optimization
  - code generation

**Runtime systems** deals with 
  PL runtime:
  - Runtime environment
  - Virtual Machine
  - Garbage Collection
  - Foreign Function Interface
