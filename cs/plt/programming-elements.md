# Programming Elements

Computer scientists use algorithmic process to create, describe and transform information and formulate suitable abstractions to design and model complex systems.

Controlling complexity
- by building abstractions that hide details when appropriate.
- by establishing conventional interfaces that enable us to construct systems by combining standard, well-understood, pieces.
- by establishing languages that efficiently describe a design

Mathematics deals with notions of *what is*, while CS deals with *how to*.


## Building Abstractions

Computational processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes.

A computational process can perform intellectual work, answer questions, affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory.

Programs that control computational processes are composed from symbolic expressions in a programming language that prescribes the tasks we want a processes to perform. A computational process executes programs in a deterministic way, precisely and accurately.

Well-designed computational systems are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be manipulated separately.



## The Elements of Programming

Programming languages serve as means for instructing a computer to perform tasks, but also as a framework for organizing concepts, building complex from simpler ones.

Every language provides:
* **Primitive expressions** represent the basic elements of language.
* **Means of combination** to build compound from simpler elements.
* **Means of abstraction** to manipulate the elements as units.

Elements in programming:
- **procedures**
- **data**

Informally, data is “stuff” that we want to manipulate, and procedures are
descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. us, any powerful
programming language should be able to describe primitive data and
primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.
