A programming language (pl) is a **formal language** that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.

- PL generally consist of instructions for a computer.
- PL is used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.
- PL description: syntax and semantics


The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of **syntax** and **semantics**.

Programming languages usually contain **abstractions** for defining and manipulating data or controlling the execution flow.

**Primitives**, the basic building blocks of a PL, are the most basic data types and their transformation routines, defined by syntactic rules (describe data structure) and semantic rules (describe their meaning).

**Syntax** is the set of rules that defines the allowed combinations of symbols.

**Semantics** refers to the meaning of language.

An **expression** is a combination of one or more literals, constants, variables, operators or functions that the PL interprets producing another value. This process is called _evaluation_.

A **statement** is the smallest standalone element that expresses some action to be carried out. A statement may have internal components (e.g. expressions). Many languages make a distinction between statements and definitions, with a statement only containing executable code and a **definition** instantiating an identifier, while an expression evaluates to a value only. A distinction can also be made between simple and compound statements; the latter may contain statements as components.

An expression is evaluated, a statement is executed and a definition (declaration) instantiates (declares) an **identifier**.

A **language construct** is a syntactically allowable part of a program that may be formed from one or more lexical tokens in accordance with the rules of a programming language. It is the way a programming language is written.
