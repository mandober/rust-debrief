# Process

A process is an instance of a program that is being executed, containing the program code and its activity.



**Synchronization** refers to one of two distinct but related concepts: synchronization of processes and synchronization of data.

Process synchronization refers to the idea that multiple processes are to join up or handshake at a certain point, in order to reach an agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action.

**Race condition** is the behavior of an electronics, software, or other system where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended.

**Deadlock** is a state in which each member of a group of threads is waiting for another member to take action (such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a lock). Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing systems, parallel computing and distributed systems, where software and hardware locks are used to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization.

In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process.
