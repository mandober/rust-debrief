# Machine code

Machine code:
* General concepts:
  - Instruction set
  - Opcode
    - Illegal opcode
    - Opcode prefix
    - Opcode table
  - Operand
* Instructions:
  - NOP
  - Branch
    - Indirect branch


- Machine code is the (only) language a computer processes directly.
- machine code is a stream of raw binary data (sequences of 1's and 0's).


A programmer coding in "machine code" normally codes instructions and data in a more readable form such as hexadecimal which is translated to internal format by a program called a **loader**.
