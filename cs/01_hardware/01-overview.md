# Overview

Computers generally consist of 3 main parts:
1. Central processing unit (CPU) to processes data
2. Memory to store the data to be processed
3. I/O devices to provide communication facilities

A modern computer's main parts may consist of a multi-core CPU, DDR4 SDRAM for main memory and an SSD for secondary memory; optinally, also a separate GPU card and a HDD for tertiary memory storage. Modern peripherals include, an LCD monitor for display, a mouse and keyboard for user interaction, and a LAN and Wi-Fi devices for networking.

Whatever the system's specs, computer buses move data between all of these devices.
