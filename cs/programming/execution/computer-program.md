# Computer program

A computer program is a structured collection of instruction sequences that perform a specific task when executed by a computer. A compiler derives machine code from the authoring format, called the source code. Machine code consists of instructions that the computer can directly execute. Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter.

A formal model of some part of a computer program that performs a general and well-defined task is called an _algorithm_. A collection of computer programs, _libraries_, and related data are referred to as _software_. Computer programs may be categorized along functional lines, such as application software and system software.
