# Memory leak

[Memory leak | Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Memory_leak)


A memory leak occurs when a program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released.

In object-oriented programming, a memory leak may happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code.

A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code.

A _space leak_ occurs when a computer program uses more memory than necessary. In contrast to memory leaks, where the leaked memory is never released, the memory consumed by a space leak is released, but later than expected.

Because they can exhaust available system memory as an application runs, memory leaks are often the cause of or a contributing factor to software aging.
