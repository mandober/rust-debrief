# Main Memory
- The main memory is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while the processor is executing the program.
- Physically, main memory consists of a collection of dynamic random access memory(DRAM) chips.
- Logically, memory is organized as a linear array of bytes, each with its own unique address (array index) starting at zero.
- In general, each of the machine instructions that constitute a program can consist of a variable number of bytes. 
- The sizes of data items that correspond to C program variables vary according to type. For example, on an x86-64 machine running Linux, data of type short require 2 bytes, types int and float 4 bytes, and types long and double 8 bytes.
