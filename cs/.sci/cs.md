# Computer science

Computer science or computing science (CS) is the study of the theoretical foundations of **information** and **computation**.

It includes practical techniques for their *implementation and application* in computer systems.

Computer scientists use algorithmic process to create, describe and transform information and formulate suitable abstractions to design and model complex systems.




Computer science is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems. Computing science encompasses many branches; some emphasize the computation of specific results (such as computer graphics), while others (such as computational complexity theory) relate to properties of computational problems. Still others focus on the challenges in implementing computations. For example, programming language theory studies approaches to describing a computation, while computer programming applies specific programming languages to craft a solution to some concrete computational problems.
