## Primitive and Non Primitive Data Structure
The data structure that are atomic (indivisible) are called primitive. Examples are integer, real and characters. The Data structures that are not atomic are called non-primitive or composite. Examples are records, array and string.

## Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures
In a linear data structure, the data items are arranged in a linear sequence. For Example: array. In a non-linear data structure, the data items that are not in sequence. For Example: trees and graphs.

## Homogeneous and Non-Homogeneous Data Structures
In homogeneous data structure, all the elements are of same type. For Example: arrays. In non-homogeneous data structure, the elements may or may not be of the same type. For Example: Records.

## Static and Dynamic Data Structures
Static data structures are those whose size and structures, associated location is fixed at compile time.Dynamic structures are ones whose ones which expand or shrink as required during the program execution and there associate memory location change.
