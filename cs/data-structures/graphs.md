# Graph

## Key terms

Assignment problem: Tat of fnding a perfect matching of maximum (or minimum) total weight

Augmenting path: An alternating path that can be used to augment (increase) the size of a matching

Biconnected graph: A graph that cannot be disconnected by the removal of any single vertex

Bipartite graph: A graph in which the vertex set can be partitioned into two sets X and Y, such that each edge connects a node in X with a node in Y

Blocking ﬂow: A ﬂow function in which any directed path from s to t contains a saturated edge
Branching: A spanning tree in a rooted graph, such that the root has a path to each vertex
Chinese postman problem: Asks for a minimum length tour that traverses each edge at least once
Connected: A graph in which there is a path between each pair of vertices
Cycle: A path in which the start and end vertices of the path are identical
Degree: Te number of edges incident to a vertex in a graph
DFS forest: A rooted forest formed by DFS
Directed acyclic graph: A directed graph with no cycles
Eulerian graph: A graph that has an Euler tour
Euler tour problem: Asks for a traversal of the edges that visits each edge exactly once
Forest: An acyclic graph
Leaves: Vertices of degree one in a tree
Matching: A subset of edges that do not share a common vertex
Minimum spanning tree: A spanning tree of minimum total weight
Network ﬂow: An assignment of ﬂow values to the edges of a graph that satisfes ﬂow conservation, skew
symmetry, and capacity constraints
Path: An ordered list of edges such that any two consecutive edges are incident to a common vertex
Perfect matching: A matching in which every node is matched by an edge to another node
Sparse graph: A graph in which |E| ≪ |V|2
s–t cut: A partitioning of the vertex set into S and T such that s ∈ S and t ∈ T
Strongly connected: A directed graph in which there is a directed path in each direction between each
pair of vertices
Topological order: A linear ordering of the edges of a DAG such that every edge in the graph goes from
lef to right

Traveling salesman problem: Asks for a minimum length tour of a graph that visits all of the vertices
exactly once
Tree: An acyclic graph with |V| − 1 edges
Walk: An ordered sequence of edges (in which edges could repeat) such that any two consecutive edges
are incident to a common vertex
