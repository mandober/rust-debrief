# Keywords

- strict
- weak
- reserved
  * unstable
  * future use
  * deprecated


The keywords are reserved by the Rust language and may not be used as identifiers such as names of functions, variables, parameters, struct fields, modules, crates, constants, macros, static values, attributes, types, traits, or lifetimes.

Majority of keywords are strict - they can only be used in their correct contexts. For example, it is not allowed to declare a variable named "struct".

Small subset of keywords are "weak" - they have special meaning only in certain contexts. For example, it is possible to declare a variable or method with the name "union".

Language also reserves a set of keywords, either for future use or because they have been deprecated. Unstable keywords are a subset of reserved keywords that can be used today under a feature flag.
