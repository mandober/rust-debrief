# Rust Debrief

Rust by bullet point: from summary to particularity

Rust: the digested and the detailed. Notes, lists, references, indices, tables, cheat-sheets and other by-products of my Rust accretion primarily through official channels: both versions of the Book, Reference, Rustonomicon, Unstable Book, Rust by Example, The Cookbook, Internals Forum, The Grammar, The Style guide, The Cargo Book, User Forum, The Official Blog, The Error Index, RFCs, FAQ, as well as from many other places I encounter while studying Rust. Noting things down, classifying, indexing... distilling while instilling.
