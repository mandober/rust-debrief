# Rust Debrief

Rust debrief: from summary to particularity

- [GitHub](https://github.com/mandober/rust-debrief)
- [GitBooks](https://mandober.gitbooks.io/rust-debrief)

Rust by bullet point, debriefings followed by details: notes, sorted lists, reminders, quick reference, cheat-sheets and other by-products of my perpetual assimilation (oxidation?) process. Or:

```rust
impl<T> Debriefing for Topic<T> where T: Rust {
  fn debriefing(&self) -> Summary;
}

impl<T> Details for Topic<T> where T: Rust {
  fn details(&self) -> Particularity;
}
```

Material contained is aggregated primarily from Rust's official documentation, both versions of the Rust Book, Rust Reference, Rustonomicon, Unstable Book, Rust by Example, Rust Cookbook, various RFCs, Rust FAQ, Rust internals forum, Rust user forum, Rust grammar, Rust style guide, rustdoc book, Cargo book, Rust official blog, Compiler Error Index, as well as from many other places I encounter while studying Rust. A work in progress never to be completed.
