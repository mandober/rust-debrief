# Rust Debrief

Rust by bullet point: from summary to particularity

_Hoarding Rust    
articles, posts, notes, tips, listings, indices, maps, references, cheat-sheets and other products of my Rust accretion. Many concepts are still verbatim copies of the original articles or their excerpts, waiting to be digested, analyzed, summarized, classified, or at least properly linked.

_Material    
mostly gathered by rummaging through official channels (API reference, the Old and the New Book, Rust Reference, The Rustonomicon, The Unstable Book, Rust by Example, The Rust Cookbook, Internals and User Forum, The Grammar, The Style guide, The Cargo Book, Rust official blog, The API Guidelines, The Error Index, RFCs, the FAQ, The Compiler Guide, Rust Edition Guide, etc.) and many other encountered resources.

_Purpose  _Rationale    
Trying to get a better grasp on the huge Rust universe (and beyond, towards CS in general), an insight of what is available, where it's located and how it all fits together. An attempt to extract essentials in the form of bullet-point summary, followed by detailed explanation (consolidation through explanation learning principle).

<summary>Research</summary>
- [ ] Collapsible mind-map of all std items.
- [ ] Canonical crates. For discoverability. Gathered de facto standard crates comprising a sega-mega meta-crate that re-exports paths from containing children crates respecting and mimicking the std paths.
(well-established crates complementing std mimicking std paths)
