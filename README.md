Hoarding Rust: notes, tips, listings, indices, maps, references, cheat-sheets and other by-products of my Rust accretion, gathered mostly by rummaging through official resources (API reference, the old and new Book, Rust Reference, The Rustonomicon, The Unstable Book, Rust by Example, The Rust Cookbook, Internals and User Forum, The Grammar, The Style guide, The Cargo Book, Rust official blog, The API Guidelines, The Error Index, RFCs, the FAQ, The Compiler Guide), but also from many other encountered resources.

about
Trying to get a better grasp on the huge Rust universe (and beyond, towards CS in general), preferably linearly, in increasing complexity, and an overview to help get a sense of what is available, where is it located and how it all fits together. Raw project stage.

research
- collapsible mind-map of all std items, organized per module
- supercrate re-exporting the established crates ("std-extras", mimicking and complementing std paths)
