# Rust Debrief

Rust debrief: from summary to particularity

- [GitHub](https://github.com/mandober/rust-debrief)
- [GitBooks](https://mandober.gitbooks.io/rust-debrief)


Rust by bullet point, debriefings followed by details: notes, sorted lists, reminders, quick reference, cheat-sheets and other by-products of my perpetual process of assimilation (oxidation?).


```rust
impl Debriefing for Topic {
  fn debriefing(&self) -> Summary;
}

impl Details for Topic {
  fn details(&self) -> Particularity;
}
```


hubristic taglines:
- Rust debrief: from summary to particularity
- Rust, one bullet (point) at the time
- Notes on Rust accretion
- Consuming Rust reference
