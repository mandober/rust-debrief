Hoarding Rust    
Articles, posts, notes, tips, listings, indices, maps, references, cheat-sheets and other products of my Rust accretion, gathered by rummaging through official resources (API reference, the Old and the New Book, Rust Reference, The Rustonomicon, The Unstable Book, Rust by Example, The Rust Cookbook, Internals and User Forum, The Grammar, The Style guide, The Cargo Book, Rust official blog, The API Guidelines, The Error Index, RFCs, the FAQ, The Compiler Guide, Rust Edition Guide, etc.) and many other sources, as well as my own production.
   
   
   
Purpose    
Trying to get a better grasp on the huge Rust universe (and beyond, towards CS in general), preferably linearly and gradually increasing in complexity, in order to get a better insight of what is available, where it is located and how it all fits together.

Research     
- collapsible mind-map of std items
