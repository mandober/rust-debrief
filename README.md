**About**    
Collection of notes about various CS topics, largely unstructured aggregation of knowledge. Planned, but apparantly unattainable page structure, was a bullit-point debrief, followed by explanatory particularities (what, why and how through summary and details). Initially, an attempt to get a better grasp on the huge Rust universe in order to form an insight of what's available, where it's at and how it all fits together; but went overboard, also touching on math, logic and CS at large.

**References**   
Rust material mostly gathered by rummaging through official containers (API reference, the Old and the New Book, Rust Reference, The Rustonomicon, The Unstable Book, Rust by Example, The Rust Cookbook, Internals and User Forum, The Grammar, The Style guide, The Cargo Book, Rust official blog, The API Guidelines, The Error Index, RFCs, the FAQ, The Compiler Guide, Rust Edition Guide, etc.) and many other resources. Sources of math and CS topics are books, numerous internet resources and Wikipedia. Some material may still be a raw, verbatim copy, waiting to be digested and excerpted; each page includes section with references.
