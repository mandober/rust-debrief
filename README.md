**About**    
By-product of my Rust accretion, gone wide. πηρ ασπϵρα αδ ραστα. Still largely unstructured aggregation of knowledge. Includes notes, articles, tips, listings, indices, maps, reference, cheat-sheets and similar. Rust material mostly gathered by rummaging through official containers (API reference, the Old and the New Book, Rust Reference, The Rustonomicon, The Unstable Book, Rust by Example, The Rust Cookbook, Internals and User Forum, The Grammar, The Style guide, The Cargo Book, Rust official blog, The API Guidelines, The Error Index, RFCs, the FAQ, The Compiler Guide, Rust Edition Guide, etc.) and other sources. Some material may be raw (verbatim source), waiting to be digested and excerpted.


**Purpose**    
Trying to get a better grasp on the huge Rust universe (and beyond, with math, CS et al.), an insight of what is available, where it's located and how it all fits together. An attempt to extract bullet-point essence of interesting topics (to serve as a quick reminder), possibly accompanied by thourough examination, motivated by the _consolidation (of knowledge) through mansplaination_ principle.
