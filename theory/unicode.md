## UCS

Universal Character Set has a capacity to encode 1,114,112 (0x110000)characters. Each UCS character is abstractly represented by a code point, which is an integer between 0 and 1,114,111, used to represent each character within the internal logic of text processing software.
- 1,114,112 potential code points (2^20 + 2^16)

As of Unicode 10.0, released in June 2017:
- 834,096 (75%) unallocated
- 280,016 (25%) allocated:
  - 136,755 (12%) assigned characters
  - 137,468 (12.3%) reserved for private use
  - 2,048 surrogates
  - 66 designated non-characters

The number of encoded characters is made up as follows:
- 136,537 graphical characters (some of which do not have a visible glyph, but are still counted as graphical)
- 218 special purpose characters for control and formatting.

The UCS can be divided in various ways, such as by plane, block, character category, or character property.


## UTF-8
UTF-8 is a variable width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid Unicode code points, using 1 to 4 bytes. Backward compatible with ASCII.

Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes. The first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond 1-1 with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8 text as well.

Since ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII code points into UTF-8, UTF-8 is safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special way, such as "/" in filenames, "\" in escape sequences, and "%" in printf.

Legend: `B` - number of bytes, `b/pc` - bits per code point

- byte that doesn't have the high bit set is a single byte encoded character.
- bytes starting with F0-F7 indicate the first byte of 4 byte encoding
- bytes starting with E0-EF indicate the first byte of 3 byte encoding
- bytes starting with C0-DF indicate the first byte of 2 byte encoding
- continuation bytes start with 80-BF



### Multibyte ranges
1. The first 128 characters (US-ASCII) need one byte.
  - range: 0-7F (dec: 0 - 127)
  - code points: 128
2. The next 1,920 characters need 2 bytes to encode, which covers the remainder of almost all Latin-script alphabets, and also Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Thaana and N'Ko alphabets, as well as Combining Diacritical Marks.
  - range: 80-7FF (dec: 128 - 2,047)
  - code points: 1,920
3. Three bytes are needed for characters in the rest of the Basic Multilingual Plane, which contains virtually all characters in common use including most Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters.
  - range: 800-FFFF (dec: 2,048 - 65,535)
  - code points: 63,488
4. Four bytes are needed for characters in the other planes of Unicode, which include less common CJK characters, various historic scripts, mathematical symbols, and emoji.
  - range: 10000-10FFFF (dec: 65,535 - ‭1,114,111‬)
  - code points: ‭10,485,756



## Code Point Type
Any of the 7 fundamental classes of code points in the standard: 
- Graphic
- Format
- Control
- Private-Use
- Surrogate
- Noncharacter
- Reserved

## Unicode Code Point
1. Any value in the Unicode codespace, from 0 to U+10FFFF; not all code points are assigned to encoded characters.
2. A value, or position, for a character, in any coded character set.

## Unicode Scalar Value
Any Unicode code point except high-surrogate and low-surrogate code points. It is in the range: 0 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to 10FFFF inclusive.

## Surrogate Code Point
A Unicode code point in the range U+D800 - U+DFFF. Reserved for use by UTF-16, where a surrogate pair "stands in" for a supplementary code point.

## Surrogate Pair
A representation for a single abstract character - a sequence of two 16-bit code units, where the first value of the pair is a high-surrogate code unit, and the second is a low-surrogate code unit.




## ASCII
The set of 128 Unicode characters from U+0000 to U+007F, including control codes as well as graphic characters. ASCII completely maps to UTF-8 Unicode encoding; this means that any ASCII encoded text is valid UTF-8.

## Byte Order Mark (BOM)
The Unicode character U+FEFF when used to indicate the byte order of a text. 

## Canonical
1. Conforming to the general rules for encoding—that is, not compressed, compacted, or in any other form specified by a higher protocol.
2. Characteristic of a normative mapping and form of equivalence specified in Chapter 3, Conformance.

## Canonical Composition
A step in the algorithm for Unicode Normalization Forms, during which decomposed sequences are replaced by primary composites, where possible. (See definition D115 in Section 3.11, Normalization Forms.)

## Canonical Decomposable Character
A character that is not identical to its canonical decomposition. (See definition D69 in Section 3.7. Decomposition.)

## Canonical Decomposition
Mapping to an inherently equivalent sequence—for example, mapping ä to a +  combining umlaut. (For a full, formal definition, see definition D68 in Section 3.7. Decomposition.)

## Canonical Equivalent
Two character sequences are said to be canonical equivalents if their full canonical decompositions are identical. (See definition D70 in Section 3.7. Decomposition.)

## Character
1. The smallest component of written language that has semantic value; refers to the abstract meaning and/or shape, rather than a specific shape, though in code tables some form of visual representation is essential for the reader’s understanding.
2. Synonym for abstract character.
3. The basic unit of encoding for the Unicode character encoding.
4. The English name for the ideographic written elements of Chinese origin.

## Glyph
1. An abstract form that represents one or more glyph images.
2. A synonym for glyph image. In displaying Unicode character data, one or more glyphs may be selected to depict a particular character. These glyphs are selected by a rendering engine during composition and layout processing.


**Abstract character** is a unit of information used for the organization, control, or representation of textual data. It has no concrete form and should not be confused with a glyph. It does not necessarily correspond to what a user thinks of as a "character" and should not be confused with a grapheme. Abstract character sequence is an ordered sequence of one or more abstract characters.

**Unicode codespace** is a range of integers `from 0 to 0x10FFFF`. **Code point** is any value in the Unicode codespace. **Code point type** is any of the seven fundamental classes of code points in the standard: Graphic, Format, Control, Private-Use, Surrogate, Noncharacter, Reserved.

**Block** is a named range of code points for organizing allocation of chars. The range for each block is defined as a contiguous sequence; a block cannot consist of two (or more) discontiguous sequences of code points.  Each range for a defined block starts with a value for which `code point MOD 16 = 0` and terminates with a larger value for which `code point MOD 16 = 15`. This specification results in block ranges which always include full code point columns for code chart display. A block never starts or terminates in mid-column. All assigned characters are contained within ranges for defined blocks. Blocks may contain reserved code points, but no block contains only reserved code points. The majority of reserved code points are outside the ranges of defined blocks.

**Encoded character** is an association (or mapping) between an abstract character and a code point. While an encoded character is formally defined in terms of the mapping between an abstract character and a code point, informally it can be thought of as an abstract character taken together with its assigned code point. 

Occasionally, for compatibility with other standards, a single abstract character may correspond to more than one code point. For example, "Å" corresponds both to U+00C5 "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE" and to 
U+212B "ANGSTROM SIGN". 

A single abstract character may also be represented by a sequence of code points. For example, latin capital letter 'G' with acute may be represented by the sequence `<U+0047 latin capital letter g, U+0301 combining acute accent>`, rather than being mapped to a single code point.

**Noncharacter** is a code point that is permanently reserved for internal use. Noncharacters consist of the values `U+nFFFE` and `U+nFFFF` (where `n` is from 0 to 1016) and the values `U+FDD0..U+FDEF`. These code points are permanently reserved as noncharacters.

**Reserved code point** is any code point of the Unicode Standard that is reserved for future assignment. Also known as an unassigned code point. Surrogate code points and noncharacters are considered assigned code points, but not assigned characters.
