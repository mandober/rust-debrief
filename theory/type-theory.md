# Type Theory

Type theory is closely related to, and in some cases overlaps with, type systems. In a system of type theory, each term (expression) has a type and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type. A typing judgment `E: T` describes that the term E has type T. For example, `int` may be a type representing (positive) integers and 0, 1, 2, ... may be members of that type. The judgement that 42 has a type `int` is written as `42: int`.

A function in type theory is denoted with an arrow, `->`. The function `addOne` (commonly called successor or increment), has the judgement `addOne: int -> int`, maining that it takes an integer and retuns an integer.
