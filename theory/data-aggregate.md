# Data Aggregate

An aggregate is a group of primitives that are logically contiguous in memory and that are viewed collectively as one datum.

For example, an aggregate could be 3 logically contiguous bytes, the values of which represent the 3 coordinates of a point in space.

When an aggregate is entirely composed of the same type of primitive, it is called an array.
