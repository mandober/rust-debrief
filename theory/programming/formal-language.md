# Formal language
A formal language is a set of strings of **symbols** together with a set of **rules** that are specific to it.

The alphabet of a formal language is the set of symbols, letters, or tokens from which the strings of the language may be formed. The strings formed from this alphabet are called words, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed words or well-formed formulas.

A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar, also called its formation rule.
