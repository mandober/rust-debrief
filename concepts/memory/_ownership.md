# Ownership

- Rust requires any references to freeze the referent and its owners.
- A reference cannot outlive its referent
- A mutable reference cannot be aliased
- The ownership is realized through binding.
- Ownership refers to the relationship of variables and values: 
  a value has only one specific owner at a time.
- ownership concept provides memory safety without a GC
- Ownership rules:
  1. Every value has an owner - a variable that owns it.
  2. There must be only one owner at a time.
  3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
- Rust avoids _aliasing_ altogether by introducing the concept of ownership: each values has exactly one owner.
- That owner is a variable and it gets that status through binding.
- value has only one owner at a time
- it is owned by only one, specific variable.
- That variable owns its value
- it is the sole owner of the value it refers to.
- Ownership of a value can change through binding: assignment, passing and returning arguments to functions or methods.
- The concept of ownership is primarily used to achieve memory safety.
- Rust creates memory pointers optimistically, 
  checks memory pointersâ€™ limited accesses at the compiler time 
  with the usage of references and borrowing. 
  It does automatic compile time memory management by checking the lifetimes.

## Borrowing
[see](borrowing.md)

- Accessing a value is done through its owner.
- Transfer ownership, give the owned value away
  - give ownership of value, let value be consumed
  - take ownership of self, consume self: `self`
- Borrow the owned value
  - borrow immutably
  - borrow self immutably, read self: `&self`
  - borrow immutably
  - borrow self mutably, write (to) self, mutate it: `&mut self`

## Dropping

- When a binding goes out of scope, the bound data is dropped automatically.
- When other value is reassigned to mut var, previous value is dropped
- Dropping a reference has no effect on the value it points to
- dropping a raw pointer has no effect on the lifecycle of any other value.



## Ownership relations

- `T`, `&T`, `&mut T`
- `FnOnce`, `Fn`, `FnMut`
- `Copy` types
- `move` in closures
- `ref`, `ref mut` in matches

1. owns `T`, `*(&T)`, `*(&mut T)`
   `move`
   consumes/moves/takes ownership
   call-by-value `FnOnce`
   method takes self: `self`
2. borrows/reads/shared reference, `&T`
   `ref`
   call-by-reference `Fn`
   method borrows self: `&self`
3. consumes/mutates/writes/mutable reference, `&mut T`
   `ref mut`
   call-by-mutable-reference `FnMut`
   method borrows self mutably: `&mut self`



`T`,`*&T`,`*&mut T` | `&T`  | `&mut T`
--------------|-------------|-----------------
**owner**     | **refs**    | **refs**
owned type    | borrowed    | mutably borrowed
own           | borrow      | borrow mutably
consumes      | borrows     | mutates
owns          | reads       | writes
`move`        | `ref`       | `ref mut`
call-by-value | call-by-ref | call-by-mut-ref
`FnOnce`      | `Fn`        | `FnMut`
`self`        | `&self`     | `&mut self`
`into_iter`   | `iter`      | `iter_mut`



__method__  
In methods, dot operator does auto de/referencing: Rust automatically adds 
`&`, `&mut`, or `*` so object matches the signature of the method.
Rust can infer whether the method is:
- `&self` *reading*
- `&mut self` *mutating*
- `self` *consuming*

__Iterator__  
- `iter`      produces an iterator over *immutable references*.
- `iter_mut`  produces an iterator over *mutable references*.
- `into_iter` produces an iterator that takes *ownership* and returns *owned* values.

__Closure__  
- `Fn`      trait *borrows* values from the env.
- `FnMut`   can change the env since it *mutably borrows* values.
- `FnOnce`  *consumes* vars it captures from its enclosing scope.
