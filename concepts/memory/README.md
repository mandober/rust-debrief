`main` is the fn: when it returns, the program is also over; it only remains to return the error (status) code to the caller (shell). So the extent of main fn is the extent of the whole program; the extent of main fn is the extent of the program, practically the `'static` lifetime. All construction done strictly within main fn itself, which is using the stack will have a stable address. main fn is in the main thread, which, like any thread, has its own stack, but unlike user-created threads, the main's stack size cannot be specified (it's already running). Just before the main's stack base address is the address of the caller (shell) that ran the program.
