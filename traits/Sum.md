# `Sum` trait
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Sum.html

Trait `std::iter::Sum` 1.12.0

Trait to represent types that can be created by summing up an iterator.


```rust
pub trait Sum<A = Self> {
    fn sum<I>(iter: I) -> Self
      where I: Iterator<Item = A>;
}
```
This trait is used to implement the `sum()` method on iterators.
Types which implement the trait can be generated by the sum method.
Like `FromIterator` this trait should rarely be called 
directly and instead interacted with through `Iterator::sum`.


## Required Methods

```rust
fn sum<I>(iter: I) -> Self
  where I: Iterator<Item = A>
```
Method which takes an iterator and generates
`Self` from the elements by "summing up" the items.


## Example of `sum()` method

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3];
let sum: i32 = a.iter().sum();
assert_eq!(sum, 6);
```
