# WebAssembly

- [WebAssembly.org][wado]
  WebAssembly or wasm is a portable, size and load-time efficient low-level 
  programming language for in-browser client-side scripting, designed to be 
  faster than JS.
- [asm.js][asmj]
  Optimizable, low-level, subset of JS as intermediate programming language 
  designed to allow software written in languages such as Rust to be run as web 
  applications while maintaining performance characteristics considerably better 
  than standard JS.
- [Emscripten][emsc]
  Emscripten is a source-to-source compiler that runs as a backend to the LLVM 
  compiler and produces a subset of JavaScript as asm.js or WebAssembly.

- [Clang][clng]
  The goal of the Clang project is to create a new C based language front-end: 
  C, C++, Objective C/C++, OpenCL C and others for the LLVM compiler.
- [LLVM][llvm]
  Collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies.
- [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen)
  Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly, written in C++. It aims to make compiling to WebAssembly easy, fast, and effective.
