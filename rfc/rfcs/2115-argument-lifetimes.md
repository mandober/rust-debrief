# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Eliminate the need for separately binding lifetime parameters in `fn`
definitions and `impl` headers, so that instead of writing:

```rust
fn two_args<'b>(arg1: &Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'b Baz
fn two_lifetimes<'a, 'b>(arg1: &'a Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'a Quux<'b>

fn nested_lifetime<'inner>(arg: &&'inner Foo) -> &'inner Bar
fn outer_lifetime<'outer>(arg: &'outer &Foo) -> &'outer Bar
```

you can write:

```rust
fn two_args(arg1: &Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'b Baz
fn two_lifetimes(arg1: &'a Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'a Quux<'b>

fn nested_lifetime(arg: &&'inner Foo) -> &'inner Bar
fn outer_lifetime(arg: &'outer &Foo) -> &'outer Bar
```

Lint against leaving off lifetime parameters in structs (like `Ref` or `Iter`),
instead nudging people to use explicit lifetimes in this case (but leveraging
the other improvements to make it ergonomic to do so).

The changes, in summary, are:

- A signature is taken to bind any lifetimes it mentions that are not already bound.
- A style lint checks that lifetimes bound in `impl` headers are multiple
  characters long, to reduce potential confusion with lifetimes bound within
  functions. (There are some additional, less important lints proposed as well.)
- You can write `'_` to explicitly elide a lifetime, and it is deprecated to
  entirely leave off lifetime arguments for non-`&` types

**This RFC does not introduce any breaking changes**.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Today's system of lifetime elision has a kind of "cliff". In cases where elision
applies (because the necessary lifetimes are clear from the signature), you
don't need to write anything:

```rust
fn one_arg(arg: &Foo) -> &Baz
```

But the moment that lifetimes need to be disambiguated, you suddenly have to
introduce a named lifetime parameter and refer to it throughout, which generally
requires changing three parts of the signature:

```rust
fn two_args<'a, 'b: 'a>(arg1: &'a Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'a Baz<'b>
```

These concerns are just a papercut for advanced Rust users, but they also
present a cliff in the learning curve, one affecting the most novel and
difficult to learn part of Rust. In particular, when first explaining borrowing,
we can say that `&` means "borrowed" and that borrowed values coming out of a
function must come from borrowed values in its input:

```rust
fn accessor(&self) -> &Foo
```

It's then not too surprising that when there are multiple input borrows, you
need to disambiguate which one you're borrowing from. But to learn how to do so,
you must learn not only lifetimes, but also the system of lifetime
parameterization and the subtle way you use it to tie lifetimes together. In
the next section, I'll show how this RFC provides a gentler learning curve
around lifetimes and disambiguation.

Another point of confusion for newcomers and old hands alike is the fact that
you can leave off lifetime parameters for types:

```rust
struct Iter<'a> { ... }

impl SomeType {
    // Iter here implicitly takes the lifetime from &self
    fn iter(&self) -> Iter { ... }
```

As detailed in the [ergonomics initiative blog post], this bit of lifetime
elision is considered a mistake: it makes it difficult to see at a glance that
borrowing is occurring, especially if you're unfamiliar with the types
involved. (The `&` types, by contrast, are universally known to involve
borrowing.)  This RFC proposes some steps to rectify this situation without
regressing ergonomics significantly.

[ergonomics initiative blog post]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/03/02/lang-ergonomics.html

In short, this RFC seeks to improve the lifetime story for existing and new
users by simultaneously improving clarity and ergonomics. In practice it should
reduce the total occurrences of `<`, `>` and `'a` in signatures, while
*increasing* the overall clarity and explicitness of the lifetime system.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

*Note: this is a **sketch** of what it might look like to teach someone
lifetimes given this RFC**.

## Introducing references and borrowing

*Assume that ownership has already been introduced, but not yet borrowing*.

While ownership is important in Rust, it's not very expressive or convenient by
itself; it's quite common to want to "lend" a value to a function you're
calling, without permanently relinquishing ownership of it.

Rust provides support for this kind of temporary lending through *references*
`&T`, which signify *a temporarily borrowed value of type `T`*. So, for example,
you can write:

```rust
fn print_vec(vec: &Vec<i32>) {
    for i in vec {
        println!("{}", i);
    }
}
```

and you designate lending by writing an `&` on the callee side:

```rust
print_vec(&my_vec)
```

This borrow of `my_vec` lasts only for the duration of the `print_vec` call.

*Imagine more explanation here...*

## Functions that return borrowed data

So far we've only seen functions that *consume* borrowed data; what about
producing it?

In general, borrowed data is always borrowed *from something*. And that thing
must always be available for longer than the borrow is. When a function returns,
its stack frame is destroyed, which means that any borrowed data it returns must
come from outside of its stack frame.

The most typical case is producing new borrowed data from already-borrowed
data. For example, consider a "getter" method:

```rust
struct MyStruct {
    field1: Foo,
    field2: Bar,
}

impl MyStruct {
    fn get_field1(&self) -> &Foo {
        &self.field1
    }
}
```

Here we're making what looks like a "fresh" borrow, it's "derived" from the
existing borrow of `self`, and hence fine to return back to our caller; the
actual `MyStruct` value must live outside our stack frame anyway.

### Pinpointing borrows with lifetimes

For Rust to guarantee safety, it needs to track the *lifetime* of each loan,
which says *for what portion of code the loan is valid*.

In particular, each `&` type also has an associated lifetime---but you can
usually leave it off. The reason is that a lot of code works like the getter
example above, where you're returning borrowed data which could only have come
from the borrowed data you took in. Thus, in `get_field1` the lifetime for
`&self` and for `&Foo` are assumed to be the same.

Rust is conservative about leaving lifetimes off, though: if there's any
ambiguity, you need to say explicitly state the relationships between the
loans. So for example, the following function signature is *not* accepted:

```rust
fn select(data: &Data, params: &Params) -> &Item;
```

Rust cannot tell how long the resulting borrow of `Item` is valid for; it can't
deduce its lifetime. Instead, you need to connect it to one or both of the input
borrows:

```rust
fn select(data: &'data Data, params: &Params) -> &'data Item;
fn select(data: &'both Data, params: &'both Params) -> &'both Item;
```

This notation lets you *name* the lifetime associated with a borrow and refer to
it later:

- In the first variant, we name the `Data` borrow lifetime `'data`, and make
clear that the returned `Item` borrow is valid for the same lifetime.

- In the second variant, we give *both* input lifetimes the *same* name `'both`,
which is a way of asking the compiler to determine their "intersection"
(i.e. the period for which both of the loans are active); we then say the
returned `Item` borrow is valid for that period (which means it may incorporate
data from both of the input borrows).

## `struct`s and lifetimes

Sometimes you need to build data types that contain borrowed data. Since those
types can then be used in many contexts, you can't say in advance what the
lifetime of those borrows will be. Instead, you must take it as a parameter:

```rust
struct VecIter<'vec, T> {
    vec: &'vec Vec<T>,
    index: usize,
}
```

Here we're defining a type for iterating over a vector, without requiring
*ownership* of that vector. To do so, we store a *borrow* of the vector. But
because our new `VecIter` struct contains borrowed data, it needs to surface
that fact, and the lifetime connected with it. It does so by taking an explicit
`'vec` parameter for the relevant lifetime, and using it within.

When using this struct, you can apply explicitly-named lifetimes as usual:

```rust
impl<T> Vec<T> {
    fn iter(&'vec self) -> VecIter<'vec, T> { ... }
}
```

However, in cases like this example, we would normally be able to leave off the
lifetime with `&`, since there's only one source of data we could be borrowing
from. We can do something similar with structs:

```rust
impl<T> Vec<T> {
    fn iter(&self) -> VecIter<'_, T> { ... }
}
```

The `'_` marker makes clear to the reader that *borrowing is happening*, which
might not otherwise be clear.

## `impl` blocks and lifetimes

When writing an `impl` block for a structure that takes a lifetime parameter,
you can give that parameter a name, which you should strive to make
*meaningful*:

```rust
impl<T> VecIter<'vec, T> { ... }
```

This name can then be referred to in the body:

```rust
impl<T> VecIter<'vec, T> {
    fn foo(&self) -> &'vec T { ... }
    fn bar(&self, arg: &'a Bar) -> &'a Bar { ... }
}
```

If the type's lifetime is not relevant, you can leave it off using `'_`:

```rust
impl<T> VecIter<'_, T> { ... }
```

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

**Note: these changes are designed to *not* require a new epoch**. They do
expand our naming style lint, however.

## Lifetimes in `impl` headers

When writing an `impl` header, you can mention lifetimes without binding them in
the generics list. Any lifetimes that are not already in scope (which, today,
means any lifetime whatsoever) is treated as being bound as a parameter of the
`impl`.

Thus, where today you would write:

```rust
impl<'a> Iterator for MyIter<'a> { ... }
impl<'a, 'b> SomeTrait<'a> for SomeType<'a, 'b> { ... }
```

tomorrow you would write:

```rust
impl Iterator for MyIter<'iter> { ... }
impl SomeTrait<'tcx, 'gcx> for SomeType<'tcx, 'gcx> { ... }
```

If any lifetime names are explicitly bound, they all must be.

This change goes hand-in-hand with a convention that lifetimes introduced in
`impl` headers (and perhaps someday, modules) should be multiple characters,
i.e. "meaningful" names, to reduce the chance of collision with typical `'a`
usage in functions.

## Lifetimes in `fn` signatures

When writing a `fn` declaration, if a lifetime appears that is not already in
scope, it is taken to be a new binding, i.e. treated as a parameter to the
function.

Thus, where today you would write:

```rust
fn elided(&self) -> &str
fn two_args<'b>(arg1: &Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'b Baz
fn two_lifetimes<'a, 'b: 'a>(arg1: &'a Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'a Quux<'b>

impl<'a> MyStruct<'a> {
    fn foo(&self) -> &'a str
    fn bar<'b>(&self, arg: &'b str) -> &'b str
}

fn take_fn_simple(f: fn(&Foo) -> &Bar)
fn take_fn<'a>(x: &'a u32, y: for<'b> fn(&'a u32, &'b u32, &'b u32))
```

tomorrow you would write:

```rust
fn elided(&self) -> &str
fn two_args(arg1: &Foo, arg2: &'arg2 Bar) -> &'arg2 Baz
fn two_lifetimes(arg1: &'arg1 Foo, arg2: &'arg2 Bar) -> &'arg1 Quux<'arg2>

impl MyStruct<'A> {
    fn foo(&self) -> &'A str
    fn bar(&self, arg: &'b str) -> &'b str
}

fn take_fn_simple(f: fn(&Foo) -> &Bar)
fn take_fn(x: &'a u32, y: for<'b> fn(&'a u32, &'b u32, &'b u32))
```

If any lifetime names are explicitly bound, they all must be.

For higher-ranked types (including cases like `Fn` syntax), elision works as it
does today. However, **it is an error to mention a lifetime in a higher-ranked
type that hasn't been explicitly bound** (either at the outer `fn` definition,
or within an explicit `for<>`). These cases are extremely rare, and making them
an error keeps our options open for providing an interpretation later on.

Similarly, if a `fn` definition is nested inside another `fn` definition, it is
an error to mention lifetimes from that outer definition (without binding them
explicitly). This is again intended for future-proofing and clarity, and is an
edge case.

## The wildcard lifetime

When referring to a type (other than `&`/`&mut`) that requires lifetime
arguments, it is deprecated to leave off those parameters.

Instead, you can write a `'_` for the parameters, rather than giving a lifetime
name, which will have identical behavior to leaving them off today.

Thus, where today you would write:

```rust
fn foo(&self) -> Ref<SomeType>
fn iter(&self) -> Iter<T>
```

tomorrow you would write:

```rust
fn foo(&self) -> Ref<'_, SomeType>
fn iter(&self) -> Iter<'_, T>
```

## Additional lints

Beyond the change to the style lint for `impl` header lifetimes, two more lints
are provided:

- One deny-by-default lint against `fn` definitions in which an unbound lifetime
  occurs exactly once. Such lifetimes can always be replaced by `'_` (or for
  `&`, elided altogether), and giving an explicit name is confusing at best, and
  indicates a typo at worst.

- An expansion of Clippy's lints so that they warn when a signature contains
  other unnecessary elements, e.g. when it could be using elision or could leave
  off lifetimes from its generics list.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

The style lint for `impl` headers could introduce some amount of churn. This
could be mitigated by only applying that lint for lifetimes not bound in the
generics list.

The fact that lifetime parameters are not bound in an out-of-band way is
somewhat unusual and might be confusing---but then, so are lifetime parameters!
Putting the bindings out of band buys us very little, as argued in the next
section.

It's possible that the inconsistency with type parameters, which must always be
bound explicitly, will be confusing. In particular, lifetime parameters for
`struct` definitions appear side-by-side with parameter lists, but elsewhere are
bound differently. However, users are virtually certain to encounter type
generics prior to explicit lifetime generics, and if they try to follow the same
style -- by binding lifetime parameters explicitly -- that will work just fine
(but may be linted in Clippy as unnecessary).

Requiring a `'_` rather than being able to leave off lifetimes altogether may be
a slight decrease in ergonomics in some cases. In particular, `SomeType<'_>` is
pretty sigil-heavy.

Cases where you could write `fn foo<'a, 'b: 'a>(...)` now need the `'b: 'a` to
be given in a `where` clause, which might be slightly more verbose. These are
relatively rare, though, due to our type well-formedness rule.

Otherwise, it's a bit hard to see drawbacks here: nothings is made less explicit
or harder to determine, since the binding structure continues to be completely
unambiguous; ergonomics and, arguably, learnability both improve. And
signatures become less noisy and easier to read.

# Rationale and Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

## Core rationale

The key insight of the proposed design is that out-of-band bindings for lifetime
parameters is buying us very little today:

- For free functions, it's completely unnecessary; the only lifetime "in scope"
  is `'static`, so everything else *must* be a parameter.
- For functions within `impl` blocks, it is solely serving the purpose of
  distinguishing between lifetimes bound by the `impl` header and those bounds
  by the `fn`.

While this might change if we ever allow modules to be parameterized by
lifetimes, it won't change in any essential way: the point is that there are
generally going to be *very* few in-scope lifetimes when writing a function
signature. So the premise is that we can use naming conventions to distinguish
between the `impl` header (or eventual module headers) and `fn` bindings.

Alternatively, we could instead distinguish these cases at the use-site, for
example by writing `outer('a)` or some such to refer to the `impl` block
bindings.

## Possible extension or alternative: "backreferences"

A different approach would be refering to elided lifetimes through their
parameter name, like so:

```rust
fn scramble(&self, arg: &Foo) -> &'self Bar
```

The idea is that each parameter that involves a single, elided lifetime will be
understood to *bind* a lifetime using that parameter's name.

Earlier iterations of this RFC combined these "backreferences" with the rest of
the proposal, but this was deemed too confusing and error-prone, and in
particular harmed readability by requiring you to scan both lifetime mentions
*and* parameter names.

We could consider *only* allowing "backreferences" (i.e. references to argument
names), and otherwise keeping binding as-is. However, this has a few downsides:

- It doesn't help with `impl` headers
- It doesn't entirely eliminate the need for lifetimes in generics lists for
  `fn` definitions, meaning that there's still *another* step of learning to
  reach fully expressive lifetimes.
- As @rpjohnst [argued](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2115#issuecomment-324147717),
  backreferences can end up reinforcing an importantly-wrong mental model, namely
  that you're borrowing from an argument, rather than from its (already-borrowed)
  contents. By contrast, requiring you to write the lifetime reinforces the opposite
  idea: that borrowing has already occurred, and that what you're tying together is
  that existing lifetime.
- On a similar note, using backreferences to tie multiple arguments together is
  often nonsensical, since there's no sense in which one argument is the "primary
  definer" of the lifetime.

## Alternatives

We could consider using this as an opportunity to eliminate `'` altogether, by
tying these improvements to a new way of providing lifetimes, e.g. `&ref(x) T`.

The [internals thread] on this topic covers a wide array of syntactic options
for leaving off a struct lifetime (which is `'_` in this RFC), including: `_`,
`&`, `ref`. The choice of `'_` was driven by two factors: it's short, and it's
self-explanatory, given our use of wildcards elsewhere. On the other hand, the
syntax is pretty clunky.

[internals thread]: (https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/lang-team-minutes-elision-2-0/5182)

As mentioned above, we could consider alternatives to the case distinction in
lifetime variables, instead using something like `outer('a)` to refer to
lifetimes from an `impl` header.
