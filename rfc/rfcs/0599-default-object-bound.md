# Summary

Add a default lifetime bound for object types, so that it is no longer
necessary to write things like `Box<Trait+'static>` or `&'a
(Trait+'a)`. The default will be based on the context in which the
object type appears. Typically, object types that appear underneath a
reference take the lifetime of the innermost reference under which
they appear, and otherwise the default is `'static`. However,
user-defined types with `T:'a` annotations override the default.

Examples:

- `&'a &'b SomeTrait` becomes `&'a &'b (SomeTrait+'b)`
- `&'a Box<SomeTrait>` becomes `&'a Box<SomeTrait+'a>`
- `Box<SomeTrait>` becomes `Box<SomeTrait+'static>`
- `Rc<SomeTrait>` becomes `Rc<SomeTrait+'static>`
- `std::cell::Ref<'a, SomeTrait>` becomes `std::cell::Ref<'a, SomeTrait+'a>`

Cases where the lifetime bound is either given explicitly or can be
inferred from the traits involved are naturally unaffected.

# Motivation

#### Current situation

As described in [RFC 34][34], object types carry a single lifetime
bound. Sometimes, this bound can be inferred based on the traits
involved. Frequently, however, it cannot, and in that case the
lifetime bound must be given explicitly. Some examples of situations
where an error would be reported are as follows:

```rust
struct SomeStruct {
    object: Box<Writer>, // <-- ERROR No lifetime bound can be inferred.
}

struct AnotherStruct<'a> {
    callback: &'a Fn(),  // <-- ERROR No lifetime bound can be inferred.
}
```

Errors of this sort are a [common source of confusion][16948] for new
users (partly due to a poor error message). To avoid errors, those examples
would have to be written as follows:

```rust
struct SomeStruct {
    object: Box<Writer+'static>,
}

struct AnotherStruct<'a> {
    callback: &'a (Fn()+'a),
}
```

Ever since it was introduced, there has been a desire to make this
fully explicit notation more compact for common cases. In practice,
the object bounds are almost always tightly linked to the context in
which the object appears: it is relatively rare, for example, to have
a boxed object type that is not bounded by `'static` or `Send` (e.g.,
`Box<Trait+'a>`). Similarly, it is unusual to have a reference to an
object where the object itself has a distinct bound (e.g., `&'a
(Trait+'b)`). This is not to say these situations *never* arise; as
we'll see below, both of these do arise in practice, but they are
relatively unusual (and in fact there is never a good reason to do
`&'a (Trait+'b)`, though there can be a reason to have `&'a mut
(Trait+'b)`; see ["Detailed Design"](#detailed-design) for full details).

The need for a shorthand is made somewhat more urgent by
[RFC 458][458], which disconnects the `Send` trait from the `'static`
bound. This means that object types now are written `Box<Foo+Send>`
would have to be written `Box<Foo+Send+'static>`.

Therefore, the following examples would require explicit bounds:

```rust
trait Message : Send { }
Box<Message> // ERROR: 'static no longer inferred from `Send` supertrait
Box<Writer+Send> // ERROR: 'static no longer inferred from `Send` bound
```

#### The proposed rule

This RFC proposes to use the context in which an object type appears
to derive a sensible default. Specifically, the default begins as
`'static`.  Type constructors like `&` or user-defined structs can
alter that default for their type arguments, as follows:

- The default begins as `'static`.
- `&'a X` and `&'a mut X` change the default for object bounds within `X` to be `'a`
- The defaults for user-defined types like `SomeType<X>` are driven by
  the where-clauses defined on `SomeType`, see the next section for
  details. The high-level idea is that if the where-clauses on
  `SomeType` indicate the `X` will be borrowed for a lifetime `'a`,
  then the default for objects appearing in `X` becomes `'a`.

The motivation for these rules is basically that objects which are not
contained within a reference default to `'static`, and otherwise the
default is the lifetime of the reference. This is almost always what
you want. As evidence, consider the following statistics, which show
the frequency of trait references from three Rust projects. The final
column shows the percentage of uses that would be correctly predicted
by the proposed rule.

As these statistics were gathered using `ack` and some simple regular
expressions, they only include cover those cases where an explicit
lifetime bound was required today. In function signatures, lifetime
bounds can always be omitted, and it is impossible to distinguish
`&SomeTrait` from `&SomeStruct` using only a regular
expression. However, we belive that the proposed rule would be
compatible with the existing defaults for function signatures in all
or virtually all cases.

The first table shows the results for objects that appear within a `Box`:

| package | `Box<Trait+Send>` | `Box<Trait+'static>` | `Box<Trait+'other>` |   %  |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|------|
| iron    | 6               | 0                  | 0                 | 100% |
| cargo   | 7               | 0                  | 7                 | 50%  |
| rust    | 53              | 28                 | 20                | 80%  |

Here `rust` refers to both the standard library and rustc. As you can
see, cargo (and rust, specifically libsyntax) both have objects that
encapsulate borrowed references, leading to types
`Box<Trait+'src>`. This pattern is not aided by the current defaults
(though it is also not made any *more* explicit than it already
is). However, this is the minority.

The next table shows the results for references to objects.

| package | `&(Trait+Send)` | `&'a [mut] (Trait+'a)` | `&'a mut (Trait+'b)` |   %  |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------|------|
| iron    | 0               | 0                    | 0                  | 100% |
| cargo   | 0               | 0                    | 5                  | 0%   |
| rust    | 1               | 9                    | 0                  | 100% |

As before, the defaults would not help cargo remove its existing
annotations (though they do not get any worse), though all other cases
are resolved. (Also, from casual examination, it appears that cargo
could in fact employ the proposed defaults without a problem, though
the types would be different than the types as they appear in the
source today, but this has not been fully verified.)

# Detailed design

This section extends the high-level rule above with suppor for
user-defined types, and also describes potential interactions with
other parts of the system.

**User-defined types.** The way that user-defined types like
`SomeType<...>` will depend on the where-clauses attached to
`SomeType`:

- If `SomeType` contains a single where-clause like `T:'a`, where
  `T` is some type parameter on `SomeType` and `'a` is some
  lifetime, then the type provided as value of `T` will have a
  default object bound of `'a`. An example of this is
  `std::cell::Ref`: a usage like `Ref<'x, X>` would change the
  default for object types appearing in `X` to be `'a`.
- If `SomeType` contains no where-clauses of the form `T:'a` then
  the default is not changed. An example of this is `Box` or
  `Rc`. Usages like `Box<X>` would therefore leave the default
  unchanged for object types appearing in `X`, which probably means
  that the default would be `'static` (though `&'a Box<X>` would
  have a default of `'a`).
- If `SomeType` contains multiple where-clausess of the form `T:'a`,
  then the default is cleared and explicit lifetiem bounds are
  required. There are no known examples of this in the standard
  library as this situation arises rarely in practice.

The motivation for these rules is that `T:'a` annotations are only
required when a reference to `T` with lifetime `'a` appears somewhere
within the struct body. For example, the type `std::cell::Ref` is
defined:

```rust
pub struct Ref<'b, T:'b> {
    value: &'b T,
    borrow: BorrowRef<'b>,
}
```

Because the field `value` has type `&'b T`, the declaration `T:'b` is
required, to indicate that borrowed pointers within `T` must outlive
the lifetime `'b`. This RFC uses this same signal to control the
defaults on objects types.

It is important that the default is *not* driven by the actual types
of the fields within `Ref`, but solely by the where-clauses declared
on `Ref`. This is both because it better serves to separate interface
and implementation and because trying to examine the types of the
fields to determine the default would create a cycle in the case of
recursive types.

**Precedence of this rule with respect to other defaults.** This rule
takes precedence over the existing existing defaults that are applied
in function signatures as well as those that are intended (but not yet
implemented) for `impl` declarations. Therefore:

```rust
fn foo1(obj: &SomeTrait) { }
fn foo2(obj: Box<SomeTrait>) { }
```

expand under this RFC to:

```rust
// Under this RFC:
fn foo1<'a>(obj: &'a (SomeTrait+'a)) { }
fn foo2(obj: Box<SomeTrait+'static>) { }
```

whereas today those same functions expand to:

```rust
// Under existing rules:
fn foo1<'a,'b>(obj: &'a (SomeTrait+'b)) { }
fn foo2(obj: Box<SomeTrait+'static>) { }
```

The reason for this rule is that we wish to ensure that if one writes
a struct declaration, then any types which appear in the struct
declaration can be safely copy-and-pasted into a fn signature. For example:

```rust
struct Foo {
    x: Box<SomeTrait>, // equiv to `Box<SomeTrait+'static>`
}

fn bar(foo: &mut Foo, x: Box<SomeTrait>) {
    foo.x = x; // (*)
}
```

The goal is to ensure that the line marked with `(*)` continues to
compile. If we gave the fn signature defaults precedence over the
object defaults, the assignment would in this case be illegal, because
the expansion of `Box<SomeTrait>` would be different.

**Interaction with object coercion.** The rules specify that `&'a
SomeTrait` and `&'a mut SomeTrait` are expanded to `&'a
(SomeTrait+'a)`and `&'a mut (SomeTrait+'a)` respecively. Today, in fn
signatures, one would get the expansions `&'a (SomeTrait+'b)` and `&'a
mut (SomeTrait+'b)`, respectively. In the case of a shared reference
`&'a SomeTrait`, this difference is basically irrelevant, as the
lifetime bound can always be approximated to be shorter when needed.

In the case a mutable reference `&'a mut SomeTrait`, however, using
two lifetime variables is *in principle* a more general expansion. The
reason has to do with "variance" -- specifically, because the proposed
expansion places the `'a` lifetime qualifier in the reference of a
mutable reference, the compiler will be unable to allow `'a` to be
approximated with a shorter lifetime. You may have experienced this if
you have types like `&'a mut &'a mut Foo`; the compiler is also forced
to be conservative about the lifetime `'a` in that scenario.

However, in the specific case of object types, this concern is
ameliorated by the existing object coercions. These coercions permit
`&'a mut (SomeTrait+'a)` to be coerced to `&'b mut (SomeTrait+'c)`
where `'a : 'b` and `'a : 'c`. The reason that this is legal is
because unsized types (like object types) cannot be assigned, thus
sidestepping the variance concerns. This means that programs like the
following compile successfully (though you will find that you get
errors if you replace the object type `(Counter+'a)` with the
underlying type `&'a mut u32`):

```rust
#![allow(unused_variables)]
#![allow(dead_code)]

trait Counter {
    fn inc_and_get(&mut self) -> u32;
}

impl<'a> Counter for &'a mut u32 {
    fn inc_and_get(&mut self) -> u32 {
        **self += 1;
        **self
    }
}

fn foo<'a>(x: &'a u32, y: &'a mut (Counter+'a)) {
}

fn bar<'a>(x: &'a mut (Counter+'a)) {
    let value = 2_u32;
    foo(&value, x)
}

fn main() {
}
```

This may seem surprising, but it's a reflection of the fact that
object types give the user less power than if the user had direct
access to the underlying data; the user is confined to accessing the
underlying data through a known interface.

# Drawbacks

**A. Breaking change.** This change has the potential to break some
existing code, though given the statistics gathered we believe the
effect will be minimal (in particular, defaults are only permitted in
fn signatures today, so in most existing code explicit lifetime bounds
are used).

**B. Lifetime errors with defaults can get confusing.** Defaults
always carry some potential to surprise users, though it's worth
pointing out that the current rules are also a big source of
confusion. Further improvements like the current system for suggesting
alternative fn signatures would help here, of course (and are an
expected subject of investigation regardless).

**C. Inferring `T:'a` annotations becomes inadvisable.** It has
sometimes been proposed that we should infer the `T:'a` annotations
that are currently required on structs. Adopting this RFC makes that
inadvisable because the effect of inferred annotations on defaults
would be quite subtle (one could ignore them, which is suboptimal, or
one could try to use them, but that makes the defaults that result
quite non-obvious, and may also introduce cyclic dependencies in the
code that are very difficult to resolve, since inferring the bounds
needed without knowing object lifetime bounds would be challenging).
However, there are good reasons not to want to infer those bounds in
any case.  In general, Rust has adopted the principle that type
definitions are always fully explicit when it comes to reference
lifetimes, even though fn signatures may omit information (e.g.,
omitted lifetimes, lifetime elision, etc). This principle arose from
past experiments where we used extensive inference in types and found
that this gave rise to particularly confounding errors, since the
errors were based on annotations that were inferred and hence not
always obvious.

# Alternatives

1. **Leave things as they are with an improved error message.**
Besides the general dissatisfaction with the current system, a big
concern here is that if [RFC 458][458] is accepted (which seems
likely), this implies that object types like `SomeTrait+Send` will now
require an explicit region bound. Most of the time, that would be
`SomeTrait+Send+'static`, which is very long indeed. We considered the
option of introducing a new trait, let's call it `Own` for now, that
is basically `Send+'static`. However, that required (1) finding a
reasonable name for `Own`; (2) seems to lessen one of the benefits of
[RFC 458][458], which is that lifetimes and other properties can be
considered orthogonally; and (3) does nothing to help with cases like
`&'a mut FnMut()`, which one would still have to write as `&'a mut
(FnMut()+'a)`.

2. **Do not drive defaults with the `T:'a` annotations that appear on
structs.** An earlier iteration of this RFC omitted the consideration
of `T:'a` annotations from user-defined structs. While this retains
the option of inferring `T:'a` annotations, it means that objects
appearing in user-defined types like `Ref<'a, Trait>` get the wrong
default.
