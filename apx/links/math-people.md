**Aristotle** (384—322 BCE), Greece    
Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidiki, in the north of Classical Greece. Along with Plato, Aristotle is considered the "Father of Western Philosophy", which inherited almost its entire lexicon from his teachings, including problems and methods of inquiry, so influencing almost all forms of knowledge. Aristotle set the roots of formalised logic.

**Euclid of Alexandria**, (325–265 BCE), Egypt    
For Euclid, mathematics consists of proofs and constructions.

**Al-Khwarizmı** (c.780–850), Baghdad    
For Al-Khwarizmı, mathematics consists of calculations.

**G. W. Leibniz** (1646–1716), Germany    
Calculate whether a proof is correct.
_Calculemus_: according to Leibniz, we can calculate whether a proof is correct. This will need a suitable language (a universal characteristic) for writing proofs.

**Gottlob Frege** (1848–1925), Germany    
Frege invented a universal characteristic in 1879; he called it "_Begriffsschrift_" (_Concept-script_). With it, Frege introduced propositional and predicate calculus.

**Gerhard Gentzen** (1909–1945), Germany    
Gentzen's system of natural deduction allows us to write proofs in a way that is mathematically natural.



## Jan Łukasiewicz
Jan Łukasiewicz (1878-1956), Poland    
Logician and philosopher born in Lemberg, a city in the Galician kingdom of Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine). His work centred on philosophical logic, mathematical logic, and history of logic. He thought innovatively about traditional propositional logic, the principle of non-contradiction and the law of excluded middle. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Łukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Łukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley - which inform modern translations of Prior Analytics by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009. Łukasiewicz is regarded as one of the most important historians of logic.

## Stephen Cole Kleene
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene
(January 5, 1909 – January 25, 1994) was an American mathematician.

One of the students of Alonzo Church, Kleene, along with Rózsa Péter, Alan Turing, Emil Post, and others, is best known as a founder of the branch of mathematical logic known as recursion theory, which subsequently helped to provide the foundations of theoretical computer science.

Kleene's work grounds the study of computable functions. A number of mathematical concepts are named after him: Kleene hierarchy, Kleene algebra, the Kleene star (Kleene closure), Kleene's recursion theorem and the Kleene fixpoint theorem. He also invented regular expressions, and made significant contributions to the foundations of mathematical intuitionism.

## Alonzo Church
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church
(June 14, 1903 – August 11, 1995) was an American mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematical logic and the foundations of theoretical computer science. He is best known for the lambda calculus, Church–Turing thesis, proving the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, Frege–Church ontology, and the Church–Rosser theorem. He also worked on philosophy of language.

## Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob Frege
(8 November 1848 – 26 July 1925) was a German philosopher, logician, and mathematician. He is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language and mathematics. Though largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) introduced his work to later generations of logicians and philosophers.

His contributions include the development of modern logic in the Begriffsschrift and work in the foundations of mathematics. His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn. His philosophical papers "On Sense and Reference" ("Über Sinn und Bedeutung") and "The Thought" ("Der Gedanke") are widely cited.

## Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932)
(27 August 1858 – 20 April 1932) was an Italian mathematician and glottologist. The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of mathematical logic and set theory, to which he contributed much notation. The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers is named the Peano axioms in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of mathematical induction. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the University of Turin. He also wrote an international auxiliary language, the Latino sine flexione ("Latin without inflections"), which is a simplified version of the Classical Latin. Most of his books and papers are in Latin sine flexione, other ones are in Italian.

## Alan Turing
(23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.


## Bertrand Russell (1872–1970)


## Emil Post
(February 11, 1897 – April 21, 1954) was an American mathematician and logician. He is best known for his work in the field that eventually became known as computability theory.
