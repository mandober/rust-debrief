## Subject Areas

Papers in CoRR are classified in two ways: by subject area from a list of subjects listed below and by using the 1998 ACM Computing Classification System. The ACM classification scheme provides us with a relatively stable scheme that covers all of computer science. The subject areas are not mutually exclusive, nor do they (yet) provide complete coverage of the field. On the other hand, we hope that they better reflect the active areas of research in CS. We expect to add more subject areas and subdivide current subject areas according to demand. Authors who cannot find an appropriate subject area should use subject area Other. We welcome constructive comments and suggestions.


`AI` - Artificial Intelligence
  Giuseppe de Giacomo and Fabio Patrizi
  Covers all areas of AI except:
    - Vision
    - Robotics
    - Machine Learning
    - Multiagent Systems
    - Computation and Language (Natural Language Processing)
  which have separate subject areas.
  In particular, includes 
    - Expert Systems
    - Theorem Proving (may overlap with Logic in Computer Science)
    - Knowledge Representation
    - Planning
    - Uncertainty in AI
  Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes:

    F.1 (computation by abstract devices), 
    F.2.3 (tradeoffs among complexity measures), and 
    F.4.3 (formal languages), 
    although some material in formal languages may be more appropriate for Logic in Computer Science. Some material in F.2.1 and F.2.2, may also be appropriate here, but is more likely to have Data Structures and Algorithms as the primary subject area.

Includes material in ACM Subject Classes J.2, J.3, and J.4 (economics).

`CL` - Computation and Language 
  (Computational Linguistics and Natural Language and Speech Processing)

Topics of interest roughly correspond to the "Hardware/Emerging Technologies" branch of the 2012 ACM Computing Classification and include:
    (1) building blocks for emerging technologies, their scalability and adoption in larger systems, including integration with traditional technologies, 
    (2) modeling, design and optimization of novel devices and systems, 
    (3) models of computation, algorithm design and programming for emerging technologies.

  This roughly corresponds to ACM Subject Classes F.1.1, and F.4.3. 
  Papers dealing with computational complexity should go to cs.CC; 
  papers dealing with logic should go to cs.LO.
