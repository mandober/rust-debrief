Some letters can occur in variant shapes, mostly inherited from medieval minuscule handwriting. While their use in normal typography of Greek is purely a matter of font styles, some such variants have been given separate encodings in Unicode.

**beta**: the symbol ϐ ("curled beta") is a cursive variant form of β. In the French tradition of Ancient Greek typography, β is used word-initially, and ϐ is used word-internally.

**delta**: the letter delta has a form resembling a cursive capital letter D; while not encoded as its own form, this form is included as part of the symbol for drachma (`Δρ` digraph) in the Currency Symbols block, `₯` U+20AF.

**epsilon** the letter epsilon can occur in two equally frequent stylistic variants either shaped:
- `ϵ`, $$\epsilon$$, ("lunate epsilon", like a semicircle with a stroke) or
- `ε`, $$\varepsilon$$ (similar to a reversed number 3).
The symbol `ϵ` (U+03F5) is designated specifically for the lunate form, used as a technical symbol.

**theta**: the symbol `ϑ` ("script theta") is a cursive form of theta `θ`, frequent in handwriting; specialized meaning as a technical symbol.

**kappa**: the symbol ϰ ("kappa symbol") is a cursive form of kappa `κ`, used as a technical symbol.

**pi** the symbol `ϖ` "variant pi" is an archaic script form of pi `π`, also used as a technical symbol.

**rho**: the letter rho `ρ` can occur in different stylistic variants, with the descending tail either going straight down or curled to the right. The symbol `ϱ` (U+03F1) is designated specifically for the curled form, used as a technical symbol.

The letter **sigma**, in standard orthography, has two variants: `ς`, used only at the ends of words, and `σ`, used elsewhere. The form `ϲ` ("lunate sigma", resembling a Latin c) is a medieval stylistic variant that can be used in both environments without the final/non-final distinction.

The capital letter **upsilon** `Υ` can occur in different stylistic variants, with the upper strokes either straight like a Latin Y, or slightly curled. The symbol ϒ (U+03D2) is designated specifically for the curled form, $$\Upsilon$$, used as a technical symbol, e.g. in physics.

The letter **phi** can occur in two equally frequent stylistic variants, either shaped as ϕ, $$\phi$$ (a circle with a vertical stroke through it) or as φ, $$\varphi$$ (a curled shape open at the top).
The symbol ϕ (U+03D5) is designated specifically for the closed form, used as a technical symbol.


The letter **omega** `Ω` has at least 3 stylistic variants of its capital form:
- "open omega", resembling an open partial circle with the opening downward and the ends curled outward, is the standard. Always used in symbolic settings and is encoded in Letterlike Symbols (U+2126) as a separate code point for backward compatibility.
- The two other stylistic variants, seen more often in modern typography, resemble an underscored full circle, where the underscore may or may not be touching the circle on a tangent:
  - in the former case it resembles a superscript omicron similar to that found in the numero sign or masculine ordinal indicator;
  - in the latter, it closely resembles some forms of the Latin letter Q.
