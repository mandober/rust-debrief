# The Rust Language

Rust is a systems programming language that is fast, memory safe and multithreaded, but does not employ a garbage collector or otherwise impose significant runtime overhead.

Rust is a compiled, statically and strongly typed language with type inference that relieves programmer from annotating a fair amount of code.
